# Mortgage Pre-Approval Process

## What is Mortgage Pre-Approval?

A mortgage pre-approval is a lender's conditional commitment to lend you a specific amount at a stated interest rate, typically valid for 90-120 days. It's one of the most important steps in the home buying process.

## Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval

### Pre-Qualification (Soft Check)
- Quick estimate based on self-reported information
- No credit check or document verification
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Not binding or guaranteed
- Good for initial planning only

### Pre-Approval (Detailed Assessment)
- Comprehensive review of finances
- Hard credit check required
- Full document verification
- Conditional commitment from lender
- Rate guarantee for 90-120 days
- Shows sellers you're a serious buyer

## Why Get Pre-Approved?

### 1. Know Your Budget
- Understand exactly how much you can borrow
- Avoid falling in love with homes you can't afford
- Focus your search on realistic options

### 2. Strengthen Your Offer
- Shows sellers you're a qualified buyer
- More competitive in bidding situations
- Faster closing process

### 3. Lock in Your Rate
- Rate guarantee protects you from increases
- If rates drop, many lenders will honor the lower rate
- Peace of mind while house hunting

### 4. Identify Issues Early
- Discover credit problems before making offers
- Time to address financial concerns
- Understand what documentation you'll need

### 5. Better Negotiating Position
- Compete with cash buyers more effectively
- Sellers prefer buyers with financing secured

## Mortgage Stress Test

All mortgage applications must pass the stress test.

### What is the Stress Test?

You must qualify at the higher of:
- Your contract rate + 2%
- 5.25% (minimum qualifying rate)

### Example:
**Approved rate: 5.5%**
- Must qualify at 7.5% (5.5% + 2%)
- If approved rate was 3.5%, would qualify at 5.5% (higher of 3.5% + 2% = 5.5% or 5.25%)

### Impact on Borrowing Power:

**$100,000 household income example:**

| Rate | Monthly Payment | Max Mortgage | Home Price (with 20% down) |
|------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 5.5% | $2,870         | $491,000     | $614,000                   |
| 7.5% | $3,500         | $393,000     | $491,000                   |

**Stress test reduces purchasing power by approximately 20%**

## How Much Can You Borrow?

### Factors That Determine Your Borrowing Amount:

1. **Gross Income**
   - Employment income
   - Self-employment income
   - Rental income (50-80% counted)
   - Investment income
   - Pension or disability income

2. **Down Payment**
   - Minimum 5% for homes under $500,000
   - 5% on first $500K + 10% on amount over $500K
   - Minimum 20% for homes over $1,000,000

3. **Existing Debts**
   - Credit card balances (3% minimum payment counted)
   - Car loans and leases
   - Student loans
   - Other mortgages
   - Lines of credit

4. **Credit Score**
   - Higher scores = better rates and terms
   - 680+ recommended for best rates

5. **Property Type**
   - Single-family homes (easiest to finance)
   - Condos (may have additional requirements)
   - Rural properties (may need larger down payment)

### Typical Borrowing Calculations:

**Rule of Thumb:** 
- Maximum home price ≈ 4-5 times gross household income
- This is rough guidance only - actual approval depends on full application

**Example Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: First-Time Buyer**
- Income: $80,000
- Down payment: $40,000 (5%)
- No debts
- Credit score: 720
- **Approximate approval: $425,000-$450,000**

**Scenario 2: Move-Up Buyer**
- Income: $120,000
- Down payment: $150,000 (20%)
- Car loan: $450/month
- Credit score: 750
- **Approximate approval: $600,000-$650,000**
