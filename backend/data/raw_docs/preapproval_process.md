# Mortgage Pre-Approval Process

## What is Mortgage Pre-Approval?

A mortgage pre-approval is a lender's conditional commitment to lend you a specific amount at a stated interest rate, typically valid for 90-120 days. It's one of the most important steps in the home buying process.

## Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval

### Pre-Qualification (Soft Check)
- Quick estimate based on self-reported information
- No credit check or document verification
- Takes 5-10 minutes
- Not binding or guaranteed
- Good for initial planning only

### Pre-Approval (Detailed Assessment)
- Comprehensive review of finances
- Hard credit check required
- Full document verification
- Conditional commitment from lender
- Rate guarantee for 90-120 days
- Shows sellers you're a serious buyer

## Why Get Pre-Approved?

### 1. Know Your Budget
- Understand exactly how much you can borrow
- Avoid falling in love with homes you can't afford
- Focus your search on realistic options

### 2. Strengthen Your Offer
- Shows sellers you're a qualified buyer
- More competitive in bidding situations
- Faster closing process

### 3. Lock in Your Rate
- Rate guarantee protects you from increases
- If rates drop, many lenders will honor the lower rate
- Peace of mind while house hunting

### 4. Identify Issues Early
- Discover credit problems before making offers
- Time to address financial concerns
- Understand what documentation you'll need

### 5. Better Negotiating Position
- Compete with cash buyers more effectively
- Sellers prefer buyers with financing secured

## Mortgage Stress Test

All mortgage applications must pass the stress test.

### What is the Stress Test?

You must qualify at the higher of:
- Your contract rate + 2%
- 5.25% (minimum qualifying rate)

### Example:
**Approved rate: 5.5%**
- Must qualify at 7.5% (5.5% + 2%)
- If approved rate was 3.5%, would qualify at 5.5% (higher of 3.5% + 2% = 5.5% or 5.25%)

### Impact on Borrowing Power:

**$100,000 household income example:**

| Rate | Monthly Payment | Max Mortgage | Home Price (with 20% down) |
|------|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| 5.5% | $2,870         | $491,000     | $614,000                   |
| 7.5% | $3,500         | $393,000     | $491,000                   |

**Stress test reduces purchasing power by approximately 20%**

## How Much Can You Borrow?

### Factors That Determine Your Borrowing Amount:

1. **Gross Income**
   - Employment income (salary/hourly)
   - Self-employment income (2-year average usually required)
   - Rental income (50-100% counted depending on the lender)
   - Investment income, pension, or disability income

2. **Down Payment Rules (Updated Dec 2024)**
   - **Homes under $500,000:** Minimum 5% down payment.
   - **Homes $500,000 to $1,500,000:** 5% on the first $500k + 10% on the portion between $500k and $1.5M.
   - **Homes over $1,500,000:** Minimum 20% down payment is required (uninsured).

3. **Amortization Period**
   - **30 Years:** Now available for **ALL First-Time Home Buyers** and buyers of **New Construction**. (This lowers monthly payments and increases your borrowing power).
   - **25 Years:** Standard for other insured mortgages.

4. **Existing Debts**
   - Credit card balances (typically 3% of balance is counted as monthly payment)
   - Car loans, student loans, lines of credit.

5. **Credit Score**
   - **680+**: Recommended for best rates and easiest qualification.
   - **600-679**: Qualifies for insured mortgages but may have stricter ratio limits.

### Typical Borrowing Calculations:

**Rule of Thumb:**
- Maximum home price ≈ 4.0 to 4.5 times gross household income (highly dependent on interest rates and debts).

**Example Scenarios (2025 Rules):**

**Scenario 1: First-Time Buyer (30-Year Amortization)**
- Income: $90,000
- Down payment: $40,000
- Debts: $0
- **Approximate Approval:** $400,000 - $430,000
- *Benefit: Using the 30-year amortization helps qualify for a higher amount.*

**Scenario 2: High-Income Buyer (Insured Mortgage up to $1.5M)**
- Income: $220,000
- Down payment: $100,000 (Less than 20%)
- Target Price: $1.2 Million
- **Status:** **Possible.** (Under the new rules, you can buy a $1.2M home with less than 20% down, whereas previously you needed $240,000 cash).
