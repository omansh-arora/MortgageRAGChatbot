# Understanding Mortgage Types in Canada (Verified 2025)

## Fixed-Rate Mortgages
### What is a Fixed-Rate Mortgage?
A fixed-rate mortgage locks in your interest rate for a specific term (e.g., 5 years). Your interest rate and payment amount remain **constant** throughout the term.

* **Best for:** Buyers who want predictable payments and protection from rate hikes.
* **Risk:** If rates drop, you are stuck at the higher rate until renewal.

## Variable-Rate Mortgages
### What is a Variable-Rate Mortgage?
Your interest rate fluctuates with the lender's **prime rate** (influenced by the Bank of Canada).

1.  **Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM):** Your payment **changes** as rates change.
2.  **Fixed-Payment Variable (VRM):** Your payment stays the same, but the **interest portion** changes. (Risk: Trigger rates if interest spikes).
