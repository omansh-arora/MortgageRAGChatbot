# Understanding Mortgage Types in Canada

## Fixed-Rate Mortgages

### What is a Fixed-Rate Mortgage?

A fixed-rate mortgage locks in your interest rate for a specific term, typically ranging from 6 months to 10 years. Your interest rate and payment amount remain constant throughout the term.

### Advantages:
- **Payment stability** - Know exactly what you'll pay each month
- **Budget certainty** - No surprises from rate fluctuations
- **Peace of mind** - Protection if rates rise
- **Simple planning** - Easy to budget long-term

### Disadvantages:
- **Higher initial rates** - Usually higher than variable rates
- **Penalty for breaking** - Can be expensive if you need to break the mortgage early
- **No benefit from rate drops** - You won't benefit if rates decrease

### Best for:
- First-time home buyers who want predictable payments
- Those who plan to stay in their home for the full term
- Risk-averse borrowers
- When rates are expected to rise

## Variable-Rate Mortgages

### What is a Variable-Rate Mortgage?

A variable-rate mortgage has an interest rate that fluctuates with the lender's prime rate, which is influenced by the Bank of Canada's overnight rate.

### Two Types:

#### 1. Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)
- Payment amount changes with rate changes
- When rates drop, you pay less; when they rise, you pay more
- More immediate impact on your budget

#### 2. Fixed-Payment Variable Rate
- Payment stays the same, but the interest/principal split changes
- When rates rise, more goes to interest, less to principal
- Could trigger payment adjustment if interest exceeds payment

### Advantages:
- **Lower initial rates** - Typically 0.5% to 1% lower than fixed rates
- **Potential savings** - Save money if rates stay stable or drop
- **Lower penalties** - Usually three months' interest if breaking early
- **Flexibility** - Often easier to convert to fixed rate

### Disadvantages:
- **Payment uncertainty** - Monthly costs can increase
- **Budget risk** - Harder to plan if rates rise significantly
- **Stress** - Can cause anxiety for some borrowers

### Best for:
- Those with flexible budgets and stable income
- Risk-tolerant borrowers
- Those who believe rates will decrease or stay stable
- Borrowers planning to pay off mortgage quickly

## Hybrid/Combination Mortgages

### What is a Hybrid Mortgage?

Split your mortgage between fixed and variable rates to balance risk and potential savings.

### Example Structure:
- 50% fixed at 5.5% 
- 50% variable at 4.5%
- Effective rate: 5.0%

### Advantages:
- **Balanced approach** - Get stability and potential savings
- **Risk mitigation** - Not fully exposed to rate increases
- **Flexibility** - Can adjust split based on market outlook

### Best for:
- Those who want some protection but also some savings potential
- Moderate risk tolerance
- Uncertain market conditions

## Open vs. Closed Mortgages

## Amortization Periods

### Example Comparison ($400,000 mortgage at 5.5%):

| Amortization | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 30 years     | $2,271         | $417,560           |
| 25 years     | $2,453         | $335,900           |
| 20 years     | $2,747         | $259,280           |
| 15 years     | $3,271         | $188,780           |

|------------------------|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Monthly               | $2,453    | 0            | $0             |
| Bi-weekly             | $1,227    | 2.5          | $7,200         |
| Accelerated Bi-weekly | $1,227    | 36           | $34,000        |

## Prepayment Privileges

Most closed mortgages allow prepayments without penalty:

### Common Privileges:
- **Lump sum payments:** 10-20% of original principal per year

### Benefits of Prepayments:

### Strategy Tips:

## Choosing the Right Mortgage

### Consider These Factors:

1. **Risk tolerance** - How comfortable are you with payment uncertainty?
2. **Financial situation** - Do you have budget flexibility?
3. **Timeline** - How long will you keep this mortgage?
4. **Market outlook** - Where are rates heading?
5. **Life plans** - Any major changes expected?

### Questions to Ask:

- What's my payment with each option?
- How much could my payment increase if rates rise?
- What are the penalties for breaking early?
- What prepayment options are available?
- Can I convert from variable to fixed later?

### Work With Professionals

A mortgage broker can:
