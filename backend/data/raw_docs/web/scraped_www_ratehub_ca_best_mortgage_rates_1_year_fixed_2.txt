### What are 1-year fixed mortgage rates?

The '1' in a 1-year mortgage rate represents the term of the mortgage, not to
be confused with the [amortization period](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-
term-vs-amortization). The term is the length of time you lock in the current
mortgage rate, while the amortization period is the amount of time it will
take you to pay off your mortgage. For example, you might have a 1-year term
within a 25-year amortization period. The term acts like a reset button on
your mortgage, at which point you must [renew the
mortgage](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-renewal-rates) at a rate available
at the end of the term.

When the mortgage rate is 'fixed,' it means that the rate (%) stays constant
for the duration of the term, whereas, with a variable mortgage rate, the rate
fluctuates based on the 'prime rate.' For example, if the 1-year fixed
mortgage rate is 4%, then you will pay 4% interest throughout the term of the
mortgage.

Keep in mind that even if you opt for a 1-year term, you’ll need to qualify
based on the 5-year mortgage rate. This standardized benchmark reduces the
risk for the lender and gives the borrower some breathing room.

### How much can I save comparing 1-year fixed rates?

Your mortgage is likely to be the largest financial commitment you’ll ever
make, and getting a better rate can save you thousands, even over just a
1-year term.

For example, on a $500,000 mortgage with a 25-year amortization period, a rate
of 3.00% would see you pay $14,721 interest over one year. With a 2.75% rate,
you’d pay $13,496 interest over the term. So, a difference of just 0.25% can
save you $1,225‬ over your 1-year term.

To see how much you could save, take a look at our rate table above and
compare the latest 1-year fixed rates. A better rate could make all the
difference!

### Is it a good idea to get a one-year fixed mortgage?

Whether a one-year fixed mortgage is a good idea depends on your financial
goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions.

A one-year fixed mortgage could be a smart choice if you expect interest rates
to drop in the near future, as it allows you to reassess and potentially
secure a lower rate at renewal. It also offers flexibility if you’re planning
a major life change, such as moving or selling your property, within a short
timeframe.

However, a one-year term may not be ideal if you prefer long-term stability,
as your rate will need to be renegotiated after just one year, and there’s a
risk that rates could rise.

* * *

### Is a short-term mortgage better than a long-term one?

1-year mortgage terms aren’t necessarily better than other terms. You should
pick a term length based on your financial needs and current situation, as
well as what rates are on offer. 5-year terms are the most popular in Canada,
as they offer a compromise between stability and flexibility. However, if
flexibility is important to you, a 1-year term could be worth considering.

[Jamie David, Sr. Director of Marketing and MortgagesJanuary 14,

Whenever you're shopping for something, it's important to understand the
different products available to you. That's also the case with mortgages!

Even though a 5-year term is the 'standard' mortgage in Canada, it's not the
only option available to you. 1-year mortgage terms are extremely flexible and
could be a good fit for your needs.  
  

## What is a mortgage term?

The mortgage term, in this case, one year, is the length of time your mortgage
rate is in effect. If you select a 1-year fixed-rate mortgage, you'll be able
to select a new mortgage type, provider and associated mortgage rate at no
penalty at the end of that year.

The mortgage term you choose depends on your expectations of future interest
rates. For example, if you think mortgage rates will go up, you may want a
longer 5-year term to lock in the current low rate. However, if you feel
interest rates will fall, or you want to renegotiate your mortgage in a year's
time, you might consider a 1-year mortgage rate.

## Comparing 1-year fixed mortgage rates

Most consumers are uncertain which direction mortgage rates will take in the
near future. Further, many are unsure if a variable or fixed mortgage rate
will better serve their finances. In these situations, a 1-year fixed rate
lets you take more time to judge the market, without locking you into a long
term agreement.

Since 1-year fixed mortgage rates are generally lower than [5-year fixed
rates](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-rates/5-year/fixed), in falling or
flat interest rate environments, some consumers continually lock into a 1-year
fixed mortgage rate year after year. However, a similar strategy can be
achieved through variable mortgage rates, which are usually lower than 1-year
fixed mortgage rates and can typically be converted to a fixed mortgage rate
at no charge.

Since the end of 2022 and throughout 2023, we find ourselves in an unusual
situation where short-term fixed rates, including those for a 1-year fixed-
rate mortgage, are significantly higher than 5-year fixed rates. This is a
result of a series of interest rate increases by the Bank of Canada that have
spurred many homeowners and home buyers to explore locking in rates for a
shorter period. The perceived benefit of this strategy is to secure stability
for the duration of one's term, but then to be able to take advantage of
anticipated lower rates in the future. If you are considering this strategy,
it's best to talk to a [mortgage broker](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-
brokers-canada) about it, as they can provide you with expert advice at no
cost to you.  
  

## 1-year fixed vs. longer-term mortgage rates

1-year fixed rates are typically lower than the rates on longer mortgage
terms, like 5 or 10 years. This is because longer fixed-rate terms lock in a
lower rate for a longer period of time. That might be great for you, but it
puts the risk of a rate rise onto your lender. The higher rate is, therefore,
a premium for locking in today's rate for longer.

These relationships aren't always constant, however, especially in very low or
high rate environments. You should always decide which term is best for you
based on the current market and your present circumstances.

### 1-year rates vs. other mortgage term lengths (interactive graph)

Some homeowners opt for a 1-year fixed mortgage rate because they plan to move
in a year. The problem with this strategy is that unless the homeowner is
moving in exactly one year, they will incur a penalty for breaking their
mortgage early. Thus, a variable mortgage rate often makes more sense in this
case. This is because the refinance penalty, three months interest, will often
be lower than refinancing a fixed mortgage.  
  

## Historical 1-year fixed mortgage rates

Looking over historical mortgage rates is the best way to understand which
mortgage terms attract lower rates. They also make it easier to understand
whether rates are currently higher or lower than they have been in the past.

Here are the lowest 1-year fixed rates of the year in Canada for the last
several years, compared to several other types of mortgage rates.

## The popularity of 1-year fixed mortgage rates

Though fixed-rate mortgages are very common, representing the majority of all
mortgages in Canada, the 1-year mortgage term is one of the least popular
terms, representing less than 10% of the market. The popularity of 1-year
mortgage rates in Canada does not vary much by age.  
  

## What drives changes in 1-year fixed mortgage rates?

Fixed mortgage rates follow government bond yields, with 1-year fixed rates
following 1-year government bond yields. Bond yields are driven by economic
conditions, and the spread between bond yields and lender-posted mortgage
rates vary by a lender's marketing strategy and general credit market
conditions.
