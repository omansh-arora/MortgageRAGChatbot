## [ Overview
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/overview/
"Overview")

The Canadian economy is adjusting to steep US tariffs on several industries
and coping with elevated uncertainty. Tariffs have led to a fall in the demand
for Canadian goods, affecting the broader economy. The reconfiguration of
global trade and domestic production is also leading to higher costs. Total
inflation has been around 2%, while underlying inflation has continued to be
about 2½%.

## [ Current conditions
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/canadian-
conditions/ "Current conditions")

Canadian economic growth has slowed, reflecting the disruptive effects of US
tariffs and a decline in population growth. Exports and business investment
have slumped. After being close to 2% for several months, CPI inflation was
2.4% in September.

## [ Tariff and other assumptions
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/section-8/
"Tariff and other assumptions")

Many countries have signed new trade agreements with the United States. US
tariffs continue to be in flux, and the future of trade in North America
remains uncertain.

## [ Outlook
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/canadian-
outlook/ "Outlook")

The ongoing trade conflict is fundamentally reshaping Canada’s economy and
will have a lasting negative impact on economic activity. At the same time,
the reconfiguration of global trade and domestic production is putting upward
pressure on costs. Reflecting these two competing forces, inflation remains
near the 2% target over the projection horizon.

## [ Global economy
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/global-economy/
"Global economy")

Global growth has been resilient. But the historic rise in US tariffs is
reshaping global trade, weighing on prospects for global growth and pushing up
inflation in the United States.

## [ Projections
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/projections/
"Projections")

Economic growth in Canada is projected to strengthen from around 0.75% in the
second half of 2025, with annual growth averaging 1.4% over 2026 and 2027.
Inflation is expected to remain around 2% over the projection horizon.

## [ Risks
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/risks/ "Risks")

Risks related to Canada’s trade relationship with the United States remain
elevated. The outlook could also be affected by risks that are not directly
related to tariffs.

## In focus

### [ Assessing underlying inflation
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/in-focus-1/
"Assessing underlying inflation")

The goal of monetary policy is to keep total inflation close to the 2% target.
But inflation can be volatile, and it takes time for changes to interest rates
to filter through the economy. This is why, when setting policy, it is
important to distinguish between temporary movements in inflation and lasting
ones.

### [ Shifts in cost pressures
](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/publications/mpr/mpr-2025-10-29/in-focus-2/
"Shifts in cost pressures")

Cost pressures are expected to ease. But businesses continue to face high
input costs due to US tariffs and the broader reconfiguration of global trade.
