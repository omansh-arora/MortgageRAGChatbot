# Our Partners

To ensure that everyone in Canada has access to safe, affordable and inclusive
housing, we need to think differently and work collaboratively. We work with
governments, non-profit organizations and private sector organizations,
including corporations, social entrepreneurs, philanthropists and other
partners to close the gap in housing needs.

  * [ Federal, Provincial and Territorial Forum on Housing  Federal, provincial and territorial governments are working together towards a long-term vision for housing.  ](/professionals/industry-innovation-and-leadership/our-partners/partnering-provinces-territories)
