In my work at the Bank of Canada, I often have the opportunity to meet with
Canadians and Canadian businesses to better understand what’s happening in the
economy at a grassroots level. Productivity is a topic that comes up a lot.
It’s an issue that features prominently in the media, public discussions and
political debates.

And with good reason. Productivity, after all, is an engine of wealth. It
allows the economy to grow despite limited resources. Unfortunately, as I am
sure you know, Canada’s productivity has been weak for some time. The Bank has
highlighted this repeatedly.1 But the situation has grown more urgent. Shocks
to our economy have become more frequent, and we are too vulnerable to their
impacts. Stronger productivity would help protect us from these shocks. It
would also give us the momentum to seize opportunities in a rapidly changing
world.

I have three goals in mind for today.

First, I want to clarify what productivity is and explain why it matters for
everyone—not just businesspeople and economists. I’ll also give a brief
overview of the current state of productivity in Canada.

Second, I will explain the scale and complexity of our productivity problem.
To put it bluntly, we’re stuck in a vicious circle. When productivity is weak,
it’s much harder to meet current challenges and seize opportunities for the
future. There is no quick or easy way to improve productivity, and no single
sector can do it alone. The challenge is complex, and long-standing structural
issues are at play. If we want to fix this, we’ll need to be thoughtful,
systematic and resolute.

Finally, I’ll end on a positive note by talking about some levers that could
help us reverse course. Improving our productivity won’t be easy. But we can
create a virtuous circle that benefits us all. We owe it to ourselves—and to
future generations.

## What is productivity and why does it matter?

Let’s start with the basics. What is productivity, and why is it so important?
I know this audience is well versed in this topic. But improving productivity
should be a priority for everyone—not just experts—because weak productivity
affects everyone. So let me take a brief detour to make sure we are all on the
same page.

In my conversations with workers and employers, I’ve learned that many think
boosting productivity means people will have to work harder and longer.
However, this is not what economists mean by productivity.

Fundamentally, productivity is a way to measure how efficiently inputs, such
as labour and capital, are used to produce a good or service. There are
several measures of productivity, but labour productivity is one of the more
commonly used in public discussions. This measure is calculated by dividing
the value of goods and services produced by the amount of labour that it took
to produce them.2 At a national level, labour productivity is expressed by
dividing gross domestic product (GDP) by total hours worked. Looking at
productivity in this light helps dispel the notion that being more productive
means working harder and longer. Instead, it means producing more with what we
have. It means producing _better_.

While labour productivity can be measured for a given quarter, looking at data
over a longer period is generally more revealing. A lot of different factors
can affect output and labour in the short term. But they may not have much to
do with the long-term trend in productivity.3

That said, Canada’s productivity has been lagging for the past 25 years at
least. The data are clear. For example, the average annual growth in labour
productivity in Canada was about 3% in the 1960s and 1970s but fell to 1%
between 2000 and 2019 (Chart 1). This decline continued through the pandemic
and persists today. And it’s not one or two sectors that are causing the poor
performance. Nor is it caused by differences in industrial structure. It’s a
widespread problem across the economy.

Even worse, over the past five decades, Canada’s productivity has deteriorated
compared with that of other G7 countries (Chart 2). In 1971, Canada’s
productivity was, on average, higher than that of its peers. By the early
1980s, the situation had reversed. And the average productivity gap between
Canada and other G7 countries has continued to widen since the start of the
2000s, particularly with the United States.

## Productivity is an engine of growth and wealth

It’s fair to say that Canada’s track record on productivity hasn’t been
stellar. But why should we be concerned? Why is there such a focus on it?

The reason is that productivity is an important driver of growth and wealth.
Our economic outlook and standard of living depend on it. In fact,
historically, wage increases and productivity growth have gone hand in hand
(Chart 3).

To better understand the link between productivity and wages, let’s consider
the concept of cost. The most important labour cost for a business isn’t the
hourly wage that it pays its workers. What matters more is what we refer to as
unit labour costs—that is, how much it costs in wages to produce a single unit
of output. This could be a unit of a physical product, such as a cubic metre
of lumber or a wind turbine. It could also be a service, such as a medical
visit, a concert or a web application.

Let’s imagine a company that takes 10 hours to produce 100 units and pays its
workers $40 an hour. The cost of labour to produce 100 units is $400, and the
unit labour cost is $4. Now, let’s say a new technology or process lets the
company produce 125 units in 10 hours instead of 100 (Figure 1). Thanks to
this gain in productivity, the company would be able to pay its workers up to
$50 an hour without increasing its unit labour cost. The company could also
translate the productivity gain into more competitive prices and thus increase
its market share. Or it could even use the profits to invest in new, state-of-
the-art equipment.

Figure 1: Productivity gains mean extra profits for businesses

10 100 10 $ 40 $ 400 $ 4 125 12.5 10 $ 400 $ 3.20 $ 40 Hours worked Production
units Productivity (units per hour) Hourly wage Production costs  Unit labour
cost Original scenario Productivity gains

Productivity gains generate additional profits that can be used to increase
**wages** or **investment** or to reduce **prices**.

So far, this example has focused on how productivity is important for
businesses and workers. But productivity gains also help monetary policy. When
the Bank looks at the factors that drive inflation, the relationship between
rising labour costs and productivity is particularly important. The reason for
this is straightforward: when productivity is strong, businesses can keep
their prices stable even if they raise wages. Let’s go back to our example. If
the workers’ hourly wage increased from $40 to $50 without any other changes,
the unit labour cost would increase from $4 to $5. It’s hard for companies to
avoid raising prices when that happens. But if wage growth is accompanied by
an increase in productivity, it has less of an impact on unit labour costs, so
it is less inflationary (Figure 2). In concrete terms, this means raising
productivity allows us to have higher incomes while also keeping inflation low
and stable. In other words, our collective purchasing power rises.

Figure 2: Productivity gains allow higher wages with less inflation

10 100 10 $40 $400 $4 10 100 10 $50 $500 $5 10 125 12.5 $50 $500 $4 Hours
worked Production units Productivity (units per hour)  Hourly wage Production
costs Unit labour cost Original scenario Wages and productivity Wages

Productivity gains help offset the inflationary pressures of rising wages.

Deep down, Canada’s affordability problem is really a productivity problem.
Inflation has come back down after spiking in 2022, but just about everything
still costs more than it did before. Everyone is feeling this. If we want to
make things more affordable, we need to raise our income. And the way to grow
our income is by increasing productivity. Even modest improvements can make a
big difference. To give you an idea, if our productivity growth since 2000 had
been similar to that of other G7 countries, our GDP in Canada today would be
about 9% higher, which translates to almost $7,000 per person.4 And as I
mentioned earlier, income growth linked to an increase in productivity would
come with little or no inflationary pressure. So it would represent real
growth in our purchasing power.

But the benefits wouldn’t end there. With higher wages, we could bolster our
retirement savings. And when tax revenues are higher, governments have more
budgetary flexibility. They can provide better public services without raising
taxes.5 Or they can fund upgrades to our infrastructure, helping the economy
become even more productive and further improving our standard of living. This
is an example of the circular nature of productivity—a point that I will come
back to later.

## Productivity fuels resilience

On top of improving our standard of living over the long term, strong
productivity also makes us more resilient to shocks and headwinds. In this
sense, strong productivity is like having a healthy immune system that can
help our economy defend itself and recover quickly.6 But that’s not all. It’s
also like having the well-developed muscles we need to go on the offensive. It
gives us the strength and agility to seize opportunities and stake a claim in
a constantly changing world. And the world is changing a lot these days.
Consider, for example, the geopolitical tensions, shifting global trade
policies and real-time reconfiguration of supply chains we’re facing. All this
puts pressure on the supply of goods and services globally and raises the risk
of inflationary shocks.7 Better productivity wouldn’t just help us deal with
these disruptions. It would also generate growth with less inflation.

For businesses, productivity gains make them more competitive on the
international stage. Businesses with strong productivity are nimbler and have
more room to manoeuvre. In fact, we know from experience that businesses with
lower productivity are generally the ones that struggle to pivot in the face
of shocks and end up having to close their doors. The radical change in US
trade policy is putting our resilience and adaptability to the test. Canadian
businesses have been forced to seek new suppliers and new markets. But are
they well positioned for success?

Several studies show the businesses that export the most are the most
productive.8 They have the muscles to take on foreign competition and the
agility to rebound faster from setbacks. The link between productivity and
exporting is at the heart of several of our theoretical models of
international trade.9 So it’s probably not a coincidence that the contribution
of exports to our GDP began to slow at the start of the 2000s as the
productivity gap widened between Canada and its competitors, particularly the
United States (Chart 4).

To sum up, our competitiveness and resilience depend on our collective
productivity. Better productivity would improve our economy’s immune system
and our ability to withstand shocks. And it would give us the muscle to take
winning shots against international competition.

## The vicious circle of weak productivity

The challenge we face is amplified by what I call the vicious circle of weak
productivity. When productivity is weak, it can be harder to strengthen it to
become more agile and resilient.

This insidious problem takes many forms. We know that Canada’s weak
productivity holds back our ability to compete in international markets. We
also know that Canadian businesses that are highly exposed to international
competition have no choice but to constantly evolve and improve. This makes
them more productive, competitive and resilient.10 And that gives them greater
flexibility to take risks and raise their productivity even more. The problem
is that too few Canadian companies are set up to face strong international
competition.

This is in large part because businesses in Canada have been investing too
little for too long (Chart 5). It’s one of the main reasons for the country’s
poor productivity.

  * [CSV](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/valet/observations/group/SPEECH_VINC20251119_C5/csv)

But Canada’s weak productivity itself is one of the factors that reduces
investment. As I explained earlier, weak productivity growth weighs on the
wages that businesses pay their workers. And the slower wages rise, the more
fragile consumption becomes and, with it, household demand for the company’s
products. Faced with sluggish demand growth, businesses are then less inclined
to invest in new equipment or technology that could improve their
productivity. Moreover, the impact of weak productivity on wages makes it
harder to keep our best workers in Canada and to attract top talent from
elsewhere.

All this further reduces innovation and undermines Canada’s competitiveness.
It also limits the flow of foreign capital into Canada and our ability to
compete in global markets.

These examples show that once an economy is caught in a vicious circle, it can
be hard to escape. In her March 2024 speech, Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn
Rogers highlighted the urgent need to increase productivity in Canada. Now
that the alarm has been sounded, it’s time to move from words to action. It’s
time to get out of this loop.

The first thing we need to do is recognize that weak productivity is a
systemic problem that demands a coordinated approach across the economy. We
need to make progress on several fronts. No one institution or group can fix
it on their own—everyone needs to play their part. But, given the tensions and
conflicts that are destabilizing our economy, reversing the trend is more
urgent than ever. Shared adversity is a powerful catalyst. Let’s leverage it.

## How can we turn a vicious circle into a virtuous one?

No doubt, the challenge we face is a big one. But by creating the conditions
for a virtuous circle, we can shape a better future that benefits all
Canadians. We will not only have more money in our pockets, but we will also
have a currency that keeps its value, more diversified trade, and a more self-
reliant and attractive economy.

Canada has been a leader in productivity before, and it can be one again.11
But we need to be realistic. Maybe Canada won’t catch up to the United States
in terms of productivity levels. Regardless of our ranking in the world, we
should learn from countries that are similar to ours and that are doing
better. And we should make improving our productivity a shared project.

So how do we do this? To start, we need to identify the most critical areas to
focus on—what I like to call the levers we can pull. This is by no means an
exhaustive list, but I’d suggest three areas in particular: creating a better
investment climate, increasing competition in Canada and investing in our
talent—what economists call human capital.12

### Creating a better investment climate

As I said at the outset, my colleagues on Governing Council and I regularly
meet with business leaders across the country to hear about their experiences.
These discussions often focus on the business environment in Canada and their
impression that it isn’t very conducive to investment. This is not a trivial
observation. As I mentioned, Canada’s low business investment over the past
several years weighs on our productivity.

While this is a complex, multi-dimensional problem, there are a few things we
could do to improve our investment climate. The Governor spoke about some of
this in September, so I’ll just give you a brief overview.13

Whether it’s in meetings or surveys, businesses often tell us that Canada’s
regulatory framework is too cumbersome, complex and far-reaching. They cite it
as an irritant that increasingly prevents them from being more dynamic. This
is the first lever we should pull. A certain level of regulation is essential,
of course. But it’s fair to ask if we could regulate better. This could mean
speeding up approval processes, re-evaluating the scope of some rules and
reducing the overall uncertainty around regulation. We also need to address
overlap, redundancies and contradictions between the different levels of
government. The same is true for the barriers that hinder the movement of
products and workers between provinces and territories.

Upgrading some of our infrastructure would also lower the cost of doing
business in Canada. For example, we could improve east–west transportation
routes to broaden our domestic market or even build new port facilities to
ship our products overseas. As well, to reduce our reliance on the US market,
we should be looking to get more out of our trade agreements with other
partners.14 As many others have said before, these factors could improve our
productivity and competitiveness by encouraging Canadian businesses to invest
and grow.

Speaking of expansion, we know that Canada has fewer large businesses than the
United States. In general, larger businesses are the most productive—and the
most likely to export and invest. For companies to form, and for smaller ones
to flourish into larger ones, it’s important that a regulatory and tax regime
support their development and growth.

### Increasing competition in key sectors

That said, even though we benefit when our companies expand, this shouldn’t
come at the expense of a competitive marketplace. Improving productivity also
means finding ways to foster strong and healthy competition in the Canadian
economy. Nobody in this room would be surprised to hear me say it can be very
hard for new entrants to break into certain highly concentrated sectors with a
few big players. Think, in particular, of telecommunications, passenger
transportation and financial services.15 These are sectors that are critical
to the entire economy. Which brings me to the second lever we need to
pull—competition.

Competition has a positive impact on productivity. It encourages businesses to
become more efficient, improve the quality of their products and services,
reduce their costs and offer better prices. Competition isn’t just good for
consumers. It also makes businesses more productive and resilient. And that’s
why we need to review and rethink our approach to competition.

### Investing in our talent

I’ve talked a lot about businesses today, but it’s important to note that
improving our productivity also relies on people. More specifically, it relies
on human capital—the knowledge and skills of workers. And that’s the third
lever we need to pull. Indeed, we need to invest in the workers of today—and
of the future—so they can do their jobs effectively, reach their full
potential and advance in their careers. That’s because, as I said earlier, a
more productive society isn’t one that demands its citizens work more. It’s
really one that gives people the knowledge, skills and tools they need to
generate more value in their work.

Consider artificial intelligence (AI), for example. It’s a technology so
transformative that it could dramatically increase our productivity. But it
could also disrupt the labour market. To get the most out of AI while limiting
the negative impact on workers, we will need to rethink some aspects of our
approach to education, and we will need to invest in training.

Investing in talent also means making it easier to recognize professional
accreditations across provinces and territories, and the foreign credentials
of people who move to Canada. Doing so would help attract the best students
and workers from around the world.

### The Bank’s role

In listening to me today, you might be asking yourself why a Deputy Governor
of the Bank of Canada decided to devote an entire speech to productivity.
After all, the Bank has little direct influence over productivity, and the
levers I just identified are outside of our purview. Ultimately, monetary
policy cannot address weak productivity. Nor can it neutralize the economic
effects of structural forces such as demographic change, trade reconfiguration
or geopolitical uncertainty. But the Bank can play a role in encouraging a
national dialogue. And in fostering macroeconomic conditions that are
favourable to a collective effort to boost productivity in Canada.

Keeping inflation close to 2 % is more than just a number. This mandate brings
real benefits to all Canadians. For households, low inflation maintains their
purchasing power. For businesses, it provides a degree of stability and
predictability about costs and prices in the economy. That allows them to
focus their efforts on improving their productivity and competitiveness,
whether by adopting new technologies, improving their processes or training
their workers. This is how—in the context of uncertainty—the Bank can create
conditions that help businesses and governments design and deliver effective
solutions to improve Canada’s long-term prospects.

The Bank can also play an important role in public debate about how Canada can
break free from the vicious circle of weak productivity. Through speeches,
such as this one today, we hope to raise awareness among Canadians about the
need to address this significant challenge. And through their research and
analysis, many economists at the Bank are working to develop and share
knowledge about productivity. Faced with such a complex challenge, we still
have a lot to learn. So we will need to be both curious and humble.

## Conclusion

It’s time for me to wrap up. I hope I’ve been able to convince you that
productivity matters to everyone, not just to economists and experts. And I
also hope I didn’t scare you too much with my description of the scale and the
systemic and circular nature of the problem!

Escaping the loop we’re in and creating a virtuous circle won’t be easy. It
will take a lot of work, creativity and leadership to get there. And we will
all need to pull in the same direction to reshape our productivity. But it’s
worth the effort. If we are successful, we won’t just improve our outlook
during the trade conflict and this period of substantial change. We’ll also
set ourselves up for long-term gains that will benefit generations to come.
And stronger growth in our productivity will mean we can increase our incomes
while limiting inflationary pressures and making life more affordable.

Even if the scale of the task seems daunting, there is an optimistic way to
approach a systemic problem. That is, if we can reverse some of the factors
that contribute to weak productivity in Canada, other improvements will
follow, creating a ripple effect. This will strengthen the country’s immune
system and give us the muscles to shape our own destiny, no matter what the
future holds. And even though the Bank’s role in this process is limited, we
will be there every step of the way. By keeping inflation low, stable and
predictable, we will help create the conditions for businesses and governments
to focus their efforts on getting our productivity back on track.

I would like to thank Ben Tomlin and Dany Brouillette for their help in
preparing this speech.

It is often said that it represents a measure of technological progress or process improvement. As a university professor, I really like this measure because it’s very pure. However, TFP can vary depending on the data sources used, so interpretating it depends on the context. For this reason, I’ll focus instead on labour productivity.[←]

Productivity spiked because overall production in the economy fell less sharply than hours worked, with so many people losing their jobs or working fewer hours. When the situation normalized, productivity fell back to more normal levels, because hours of work rose faster than output. None of this really reflected the underlying efficiency of the Canadian economy. [←]
  4. 4\. This calculation uses the weighted average of labour productivity growth rates of the other G7 countries between 2000 and 2023, using their respective GDPs in 2000 as weights.[←]
  5. 5\. As well, in the context of a shortage of health care workers in Canada, the emergence of new health care technologies, including those using artificial intelligence, offers hope of increased productivity and better services in Canada’s health care systems.[←]
  6. 6\. This idea likening strong productivity to a healthy immune system for the economy isn’t new. RBC Chief Economist Frances Donald, for example, invoked the idea earlier this year.[←]
  7. 7\. See T. Macklem, “[Flexible inflation targeting in a shock-prone world](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/08/flexible-inflation-targeting-in-a-shock-prone-world/)” (speech to the Bank of Mexico 100th Anniversary Seminar, Mexico City, Mexico, August 26, 2025).[←]

  10. 10\. See A. Lileeva and D. Trefler, “Improved Access to Foreign Markets Raises Plant-Level Productivity for Some Plants,” _Quarterly Journal of Economics_ 125, no. 3 (2010): 1051–1099, and J. R. Baldwin and W. Gu, “Export-Market Participation and Productivity Performance in Canadian Manufacturing,” _Canadian Journal of Economics_ 36, no. 3 (2003): 634–657.[←]
  11. 11\. See A. Sharpe and T. Sargent, “Finances of the Nation: The Canadian Productivity Landscape: An Overview,” _Canadian Tax Journal_ , forthcoming. The authors note that, from 1947 to 1973, business sector output per hour in Canada grew at an average annual rate of about 4%, compared with about 3% in the United States. Since then, Canada’s labour productivity growth has mostly trailed that of the United States.[←]
  12. 12\. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) discusses these themes and others in [_OECD Economic Surveys: Canada 2025_](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-economic-surveys-canada-2025_28f9e02c-en/full-report.html/).[←]
