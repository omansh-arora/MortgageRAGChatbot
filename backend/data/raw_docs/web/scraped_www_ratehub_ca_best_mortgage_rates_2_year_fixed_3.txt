### What are 2-year fixed mortgage rates?

A 2-year mortgage rate refers to the term of your mortgage—not the
amortization period. The term is how long your current mortgage rate is locked
in, while the [amortization period](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-term-vs-
amortization) is the total time it will take to fully pay off your mortgage.
At the end of the 2-year term, your mortgage effectively “resets,” meaning
you’ll have to renew it at a then-available rate. A mortgage might, for
example, have a 2-year term and a 25-year amortization period.

When the mortgage rate is 'fixed,' it stays the same throughout the term. If
your 2-year fixed rate is 4%, then you will pay 4% interest each year for two
years. By contrast, a variable mortgage rate fluctuates with the market
interest rate (the “prime rate”).

It's worth noting that all borrowers, even those applying for a 2-year term,
will need to meet the standards of approval for the 5-year mortgage rate. This
is a standardized benchmark applied to reduce the risk for the lender and to
give the borrower some breathing room.

* * *

### Is it possible to get a 2-year mortgage?

While variable-rate mortgages are generally not available in 2-year terms, you
can certainly get a 2-year fixed-rate mortgage. In fact, numerous lenders
including the Big 5 Banks, credit unions and smaller banks all offer 2-year
fixed-rate mortgage products. For a full range of 2-year fixed mortgage rates
from a wide variety of providers, check out our rate table above. It’s updated
throughout the day, ensuring that you’re always seeing the best and most
current 2-year fixed mortgage rates on offer.

### Is a 2-year fixed-rate mortgage worth it?

A 2-year fixed-rate mortgage is definitely worth it if you want the security
of having fixed, unchanging mortgage payments for a relatively short period of
time. Much of this has to do with your appetite for risk, and whether you are
optimistic or pessimistic about the near-term future of mortgage rates.

After 10 rate hikes from March 2022 to July 2023, the Bank of Canada cut its
policy rate five times in 2024, bringing it down to 3.25%, reflecting signs
that [inflation](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgages/canada-cpi-inflation-rate)
is cooling. In fact, the latest Consumer Price Index shows inflation at 1.9%,
which is just under the Bank of Canada’s 2% target. If inflation remains at or
below this level, the Bank may continue to keep rates steady or potentially
cut them further.

However, it’s important to remember that monetary policy can change quickly if
new economic data suggests inflation is picking up again. If you’re risk-
averse and want short-term stability, a 2-year fixed rate can offer a “safe
zone.” You’ll protect yourself against sudden increases while also staying
flexible if rates drop, as you’ll renew in two years, and can make a change to
your mortgage then without penalty.

Ultimately, your decision should reflect your view on future rate movements
and your personal financial goals.

### Can I change my 2-year fixed mortgage to a 5-year?

As with any mortgage term, at the end of your 2-year mortgage term, you can
renew your mortgage with your existing lender, or switch lenders to get a more
desirable mortgage product. Since you will already have had to qualify for
your 2-year fixed-rate mortgage at the same standards you would have needed to
qualify for a 5-year fixed-rate mortgage, provided you renew with your
existing lender, you can do so without re-qualifying (as long as you’ve been
making your mortgage payments regularly and are in good standing with your
lender). Should you choose to switch to another lender and seek a 5-year
fixed-rate mortgage with them, you will need to submit an entirely new
mortgage application.

If you feel like you need to convert your mortgage from a 2-year term to a
5-year term before the initial 2-year term is done, you risk breaking your
mortgage and incurring substantial penalties. Unless you absolutely need to,
it’s generally not advisable to take this step. However, if you must do so,
you may be able to negotiate an agreement with your current lender, depending
on the terms of your original mortgage contract.

* * *

### What happens after my 2-year fixed-rate mortgage ends?

When your 2-year fixed-rate term ends, your mortgage doesn’t disappear — it
simply reaches its renewal point. At this stage, you usually have a few
options:

  1. **Renew with your current lender:** Negotiate a new rate and term length, whether another fixed-rate term, a variable rate, or something in between.
  2. **Switch to a new lender:** Shop around to see if another lender can offer better terms or a lower rate. Switching lenders can often help you lock in a more competitive rate.
  3. **Pay off your mortgage** **(if possible):** If you have the funds available or decide to sell your home, you could fully pay off the remaining balance.

It’s a good idea to start comparing rates and exploring your options a few
months before your 2-year term is up.

[Jamie David, Sr. Director of Marketing and MortgagesJanuary 14,

A 2-year fixed mortgage will have a constant rate of interest over a term of
two years. The term should not be confused with the [amortization
period](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-term-vs-amortization), which is the
length of time it takes to pay off your mortgage. The term, rather, is the
period you are committed to the contractual provisions and mortgage rate with
your lender.

2-year terms are not popular in Canada, representing a tiny portion of all
mortgages. However, they can be a very useful mortgage rate type if you're
looking for a little more flexibility. In the wake of multiple interest rate
hikes by the Bank of Canada over the course of 2022 and into early 2023,
short-term fixed rates have become more appealing to consumers than they
typically are.

## Why choose a 2-year fixed-rate mortgage

While 2-year fixed-rate mortgages represent a relatively tiny percentage of
fixed-rate mortgages in Canada, they have been growing in popularity over the
past year or so. This is in large part because many homeowners and home buyers
have grown increasingly wary of variable mortgage rates in light of the
historic eight successive rate hikes carried out by the Bank of Canada between
March 2, 2022 and January 25, 2023. Moreover, we are currently in a situation
where the best 2-year fixed mortgage rates are actually lower than variable
rates, though this is fairly unusual.

It’s important to think about not just today’s rate environment, but also your
own personal circumstances when considering a 2-year fixed-rate mortgage. Do
you plan on moving soon? Do you expect to change jobs? What else do you have
on your horizon that might affect what mortgage product is best for you?

If you are looking for short-term stability with enhanced flexibility, then a
2-year fixed-rate mortgage could be a great option. If you believe that rates
are likely to come down in the next year or two, as many financial experts do,
and you’re willing to take a risk based on your belief, again a 2-year fixed-
rate mortgage just might be right for you. If you’re feeling unsure about
whether this is the right choice, you can always speak to a mortgage broker,
who can provide you with expert, personalized advice at no cost.  
  

### 2-year fixed mortgage rates vs. other term lengths (interactive graph)

## Historical 2-year fixed mortgage rates

It’s always a good idea to have a look at how the rates for different mortgage
terms have changed over the years, as it can give you an understanding of what
terms generally attract the best rates. You’ll see in the chart below that
2-year fixed mortgage rates have not always been cheaper than variable rates,
the way they are today; in fact, for much of the last four years, they were
substantially more expensive. That said, in today’s elevated rate environment,
2-year fixed mortgage rates are quite competitive (see the rate table above
for the best rates on the market).

In the chart below, you can compare 2-year fixed mortgage rates against the
rates for other types and terms to see how they have changed over the last few
years.
