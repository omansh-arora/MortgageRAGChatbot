### What are 3-year fixed mortgage rates?

The '3' in a 3-year mortgage rate represents the term of the mortgage, not to
be confused with the [amortization period](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-
term-vs-amortization). The term is the period you are committed to the
contractual provisions and mortgage rate with your lender, while the
amortization period is the amount of time it will take you to pay off your
mortgage in full. The term acts like a reset button on your mortgage, at which
point you must renew the mortgage at a rate available at the end of the term.
A mortgage might, for example, have a 3-year term and a 25-year amortization
period.

When the mortgage rate is 'fixed,' it means that the rate (%) is set for the
duration of the term, whereas with a variable mortgage rate, the rate
fluctuates with the market interest rate, known as the 'prime rate.' So, for
example, if the 3-year fixed mortgage rate is 4%, then you will pay 4%
interest throughout the term of the mortgage.

It's worth noting that all borrowers, even those applying for a 3-year term,
will need to meet the standards of approval for the 5-year mortgage rate. This
is a standardized benchmark applied to reduce the risk for the lender and to
give the borrower some breathing room.

### What is better, a 3-year or a 5-year fixed mortgage rate?

In general, 3-year fixed mortgage rates are higher than 5-year fixed mortgage
rates. This is in part due to the fact that 3-year fixed-rate mortgages have
historically not been as popular of an option for most Canadians, so there
aren’t as many 3-year fixed-rate mortgage products available.

It’s important to keep in mind, however, that the lowest mortgage rate is not
always the best mortgage rate for your particular situation. When choosing the
mortgage term that’s best for you, you’ll want to consider a number of
factors, including your financial situation, any upcoming life plans such as a
potential move, as well as the housing market and rate environment.

If, for example, you believe that rates may be lower in 3 years than where
they are today, but want to safeguard yourself from the risk of rate hikes in
the near future, then a 3-year fixed-rate mortgage would make more sense in
your situation. If you’re unsure as to what term best fits your needs, you can
always consult with a mortgage broker to get expert, personalized advice at no
cost.

### Can you get a 3-year mortgage?

You can certainly get 3-year mortgage terms in Canada, with both 3-year fixed-
rate and variable-rate products on the market. While 3-year fixed-rate
mortgages have traditionally been less popular, the recent shifts in monetary
policy have prompted more Canadians to explore mid-range mortgage terms like
the 3-year option.

The 10 rate hikes between March 2022 and July 2023, followed by five
subsequent rate cuts in 2024 by the Bank of Canada, have led some borrowers to
seek a balance between long-term security and short-term flexibility. A 3-year
fixed-rate mortgage can lock in your interest rate for a few years without
committing to a 5-year or longer term, potentially giving you room to adapt if
rates fall further or your circumstances change.

3-year fixed-rate mortgage products are available at competitive rates from a
wide range of lenders, including the Big Banks, credit unions and smaller
local banks. For a comprehensive list of the most current 3-year fixed-rate
mortgage products on offer, be sure to check out our rate table above and shop
around.

[Jamie David, Sr. Director of Marketing and MortgagesJanuary 14,

While 3-year mortgage terms are historically not very common in Canada, as a
result of the rapidly rising rate environment that we saw throughout 2022 and
into 2023, 3-year fixed-rate mortgages have seen a surge in interest. Spooked
by high rates and market volatility, many home buyers and homeowners are
wondering whether they might not be better off with a 3-year fixed-rate
mortgage to help them ride out these uncertain times. Here's what you need to
know to help decide whether a 3-year mortgage is right for you.  
  

## 3-year fixed mortgage rates: Quick facts

  * [Mortgage rate](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-rates) is fixed over a 3-year [term](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-term-vs-amortization)

  * Just under 13% of all mortgage requests made on Ratehub.ca from January to December 2023 were for short-term fixed-rate mortgages with terms of 4 years or less, compared to just under 6% for the whole of 2022
  * 3-year fixed mortgage rates closely follow 3-year government bond yields

##  
Choosing a 3-year fixed-rate mortgage

A 3-year fixed-rate mortgage falls into the category of short-term mortgages,
generally defined as mortgages with a term of less than 5 years. Such
mortgages only account for a small fraction of all mortgages in Canada, but
interest has grown considerably over the past several months.

Over the course of 2022 and into early 2023, in response to soaring inflation,
the Bank of Canada raised the target for the overnight rate by 4.25%, from
0.25% at the beginning of 2022 to 4.50% today. This sent variable mortgage
rates soaring, while fixed mortgage rates climbed as well due to inflation
causing bond yields to rise rapidly. Faced with a high rate environment and
instability brought about by factors such as bank failures in the United
States and abroad, many homeowners and home buyers want the security of a
fixed rate without being locked in for too long. Given that experts believe
mortgage rates are likely to have peaked and will go down in 2024 and 2025,
selecting a 3-year fixed-rate mortgage is a reasonable choice if you want to
protect yourself until the situation stabilizes and rates are lower.

Of course, you must also take into account your own personal circumstances
when deciding on a mortgage term. Think about what life events you may have on
the horizon, such as a move or a job change. Do you need a little flexibility
combined with a little stability? If so, a 3-year fixed-rate mortgage just
might be right for you.

## 3-year fixed vs. longer-term mortgage rates

3-year fixed rates are typically slightly lower than rates on longer terms
(like 5 or 10 years) and higher than rates on short terms, like 1-year rates.
This is because longer fixed-rate terms lock in a lower rate for a longer
period of time. That might be great for you, but it puts the risk of a rate
rise onto your lender. The higher rate is, therefore, a premium for locking in
a lower rate for longer.

These relationships aren't always constant, however, especially in very low or
high rate environments. You should always decide which term is best for you
based on the current market and your present circumstances.

By examining mortgage rates over time, you’ll get a good sense of which

rates –- are currently higher or lower than they have been in the past.

## What drives changes in 3-year fixed mortgage rates?

Fixed mortgage rates follow government bond yields, with 3-year fixed rates
following 3-year government bond yields. Bond yields are driven by economic
conditions, and the spread between bond yields and lender-posted mortgage
rates vary by a lender's marketing strategy and general credit market
conditions.
