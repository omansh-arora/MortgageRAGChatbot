### What are 4-year fixed mortgage rates?

The '4' in a 4-year mortgage rate represents the term of the mortgage, not to
be confused with the [amortization period](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-
term-vs-amortization). The term is the length of time you lock in the current
mortgage rate, while the amortization period is the amount of time it will
take you to pay off your mortgage. The term acts like a reset button on your
mortgage, at which point you must renew the mortgage at a rate available at
the end of the term. A mortgage might, for example, have a 4-year term and a
25-year amortization period.

When the mortgage rate is 'fixed' it means that the rate (%) is set for the
duration of the term, whereas with a variable mortgage rate, the rate
fluctuates with the market interest rate, known as the 'prime rate'. So, for
example, if the 4-year fixed mortgage rate is 3%, then you will pay 3%
interest throughout the term of the mortgage.

It's worth noting that all borrowers, even those applying for a 4-year term,
will need to meet the standards of approval for the 5-year mortgage rate. This
is a standardized benchmark applied to reduce risk for the lender and to give
the borrower some breathing room.

### How much can I save comparing 4-year fixed rates?

Your mortgage is likely to be among the largest financial commitments you’ll
ever make, and getting a better rate can save you thousands, even over just a
4-year term. Even a slightly lower mortgage rate can result in big savings,
especially early on in your mortgage.

For example, on a $500,000 mortgage with a 25-year amortization period, a rate
of 3.00% would see you pay $56,355 interest over 3 years. With a 2.75% rate,
you’d pay $51,591 interest over the term. So, a difference of just 0.25% can
save you $‭4,764 over your 3-year term.

### Why are fixed rates different from variable rates?

You can think of the difference, or _spread_ , between variable mortgage rates
and fixed rates as the price of insurance that mortgage costs will not
increase in the next five years, more or less. The advantage of fixed-rate
mortgages is that you know exactly how much your mortgage payments will be
regardless of whether rates rise or fall. You can, essentially, set it and
forget it. This eases the budgeting anxiety that may follow a variable-rate
mortgage.

When interest rates are low, and the spread between shorter-term rates and the
5-year fixed mortgage rates is less significant, it is typically recommended
that you lock in the 5-year rate. The longer term offers stability and,
because rates are historically low, the chances of rates decreasing further
with a variable rate are greatly reduced.

On the other hand, as is the case with all fixed mortgage rates, there is the
potential to pay higher interest when variable rates are low, and, examined
historically, variable rates have proven to be less expensive over time.

* * *

### Are 4-year mortgages better than other mortgage terms?

Four-year mortgage terms aren’t necessarily better than other terms. You
should pick a term length based on your financial needs and current situation,
as well as what rates are on offer. 5-year terms are the most popular in
Canada, as they offer a compromise between stability and flexibility. However,
if flexibility is important to you, a 4-year term could be worth considering.

Whether you're looking to take on a new mortgage or renew your current one,
it's important to get familiar with all of the products available to you, even
the slightly more niche ones.

4-year mortgages aren't very common in Canada, with most mortgages being
5-year terms. However, 4-year mortgage terms can make sense under certain
circumstances. Here's what you need to know in order to decide if they're
right for you.  
  

## What is a 4-year fixed mortgage?

A 4-year fixed mortgage will have a constant interest rate over a 4-year term.
The term should not be confused with the [amortization
period](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-term-vs-amortization), which is the
length of time it takes to pay off your mortgage. The term, rather, is the
period you are committed to the contractual provisions and mortgage rate with
your lender.

## Comparing 4-year fixed mortgage rates

There are a number of factors supporting the choice of a short-term rate like
the 4-year fixed mortgage rate. Generally, if you believe you're in a falling
interest rate environment, where rates will stay stagnant or fall, shorter
terms are more beneficial. This is because your renewal date will be sooner,
letting you take advantage of low rates when your mortgage is up for renewal.
Short terms are also sensible if you're likely to break your mortgage within a
few years – if you want to upgrade your home, for example.

Of course, with 4-year terms being so close to the typical 5-year term, the
benefits of a shorter-term aren't as pronounced as they are with a 3-year or
shorter term. Most people would consider 4-year terms to be a balanced term
length, but offering a little more flexibility than a 5-year term.  
  

## 4-year fixed vs. longer-term mortgage rates

4-year fixed rates are typically a little lower than rates on longer terms
(like 5 or 10 years), but higher than short term rates, like 1-year rates.
This is because longer fixed-rate terms can lock in a lower rate for a longer
period of time. That might be great for you, but it puts the risk of a rate
rise onto your lender. The higher rate is, therefore, a premium for locking in
a lower rate for longer.

These relationships aren't always constant, however, especially in very low or
high rate environments. You should always decide which term is best for you
based on both the current market and your present circumstances.

Historical 4-year fixed mortgage rates

Looking at historical mortgage rates is a good way to understand which
mortgage terms generally attract the lowest rates. Historical rates also help
you understand whether rates are currently higher or lower than they have been
in the past.

several years, compared to several other mortgage terms.
