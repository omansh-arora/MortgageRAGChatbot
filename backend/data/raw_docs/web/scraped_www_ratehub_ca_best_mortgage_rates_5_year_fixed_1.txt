### Will fixed mortgage rates continue to go down in 2025?

Fixed mortgage rates are influenced by bond market movements rather than
directly by the Bank of Canada’s (BoC) rate cuts. While the BoC's recent
decision to cut its rate to 2.25% in October 2025 has lowered borrowing costs
for variable-rate mortgage holders, five-year fixed mortgage rates are
primarily guided by five-year government bond yields. Since the rate cut was
widely anticipated, fixed mortgage rates had already been adjusted to reflect
what bond markets priced in, remaining in the 2.5-2.6% range since mid-
October. As a result, the best five-year fixed insured rate is currently at
3.79%. If bond yields continue to soften, especially in response to signs of
weaker growth and subdued inflation, lenders may cut rates further in the
months ahead.

* * *

### I’m in a variable-rate mortgage. Should I lock-in a fixed-rate?

Locking into a fixed mortgage rate can feel appealing, especially after the
sharp rise in borrowing costs seen in 2022 and 2023. However, both variable
and fixed rates have shifted considerably since then. The Bank of Canada has
cut its overnight rate nine times since June 2024, most recently in October
2025, bringing the rate down to 2.25%. That has lowered the prime rate to
4.45%, which means today’s variable mortgage rates are once again priced below
fixed options. For example, the best five-year variable rate now sits around
3.45%, while the best five-year fixed insured rate is closer to 3.79%.

Since mid-2024, variable mortgage rates have trended lower, following seven
Bank of Canada rate cuts between June 2024 and March 2025, which brought the
overnight rate down to 2.75% and the prime rate to 4.95%, where it remains as
of the July 30, 2025 announcement. Variable-rate borrowers won’t see further
changes unless the Bank makes another move. Meanwhile, fixed mortgage rates
have also declined but remain under pressure from elevated bond yields. As of
now, the lowest five-year fixed insured rate is 3.89%, slightly higher than
the best variable rates, which sit around 3.95%.

Before switching your mortgage, consider the spread between your current
variable rate and the best fixed or variable rate you can get today. If the
spread between your current rate and the best fixed or variable rate available
today is greater than the expected increase in the prime rate, sticking with
your current variable rate may save you more. However, if you believe that you
can save more money by breaking your current variable rate, make sure to
account for the cost of breaking your mortgage. You can use [Ratehub’s penalty
calculator](https://www.ratehub.ca/penalty-calculator) to estimate this cost.

For those concerned about fluctuating payments, some lenders offer variable-
rate mortgages with fixed monthly payments. With this type of mortgage, your
monthly payment stays the same even if the prime rate goes up, but more of
your payment goes toward interest and less toward principal. If rates rise
significantly, you may hit your trigger rate (the point at which your payment
no longer covers the interest owed), and eventually your trigger point, which
is often when your mortgage balance exceeds the original loan amount. At that
stage, your lender may require you to increase your monthly payments or make a
lump sum payment to bring the loan back in line.

* * *

### Is a 5-year fixed-rate mortgage a good idea right now?

Fixed mortgage rates have long been the most popular option in Canada because
they offer predictable payments and protection from interest rate increases.
Unlike variable rates, which fluctuate when the Bank of Canada changes its
overnight rate, fixed rates stay the same for the entire mortgage term. In
2025, [77% of rate inquiries](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/demand-for-variable-
mortgage-rates-down-21-compared-to-2022/) on Ratehub.ca have been for fixed
rates, compared to just 8% for variable rates. However, fixed rates offer less
flexibility. If rates fall during your term, switching to a lower rate often
means breaking your mortgage and paying a penalty.

Following the Bank of Canada’s October rate cut, variable rates are now priced
below fixed, with the best five-year variable available at around 3.45%
compared to about 3.79% for the best five-year fixed insured rate. While bond
yields have eased in recent weeks, they remain highly sensitive to inflation
data and global trade conditions, which can affect lenders’ ability to
discount fixed rates further.

A fixed rate may be a good fit if you value stability and want certainty in
your payments. However, if you’re comfortable with some fluctuation and
believe rates could fall further, a variable option may offer greater savings.

* * *

### Is it better to choose a 2-year or a 5-year fixed-rate mortgage?

The length of your mortgage term affects the balance between stability and
flexibility. A 5-year fixed term provides long-term protection from rate
fluctuations, offering stability throughout the term. However, it locks you
into the rate for five years, meaning you cannot take advantage of potential
rate drops until renewal.

In contrast, a 2-year fixed term allows you to reassess your mortgage sooner,
which can be beneficial if you anticipate lower rates or changes in your
financial situation. However, shorter-term mortgage rates are higher than
five-year options, and there is no guarantee that interest rates won’t rise
during the shorter time frame, meaning you might have to renew at a higher
rate. Ultimately, your decision should align with your financial goals and
risk tolerance.

* * *

### What impact do changing fixed rates have on the stress test?

As fixed mortgage rates remain elevated compared to the historical lows seen
during the pandemic, the [mortgage stress
test](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/how-to-stress-test-your-mortgage/) threshold
continues to pose a tough hurdle for many borrowers.

Mortgages are currently stress tested based on the higher of:

  * the qualifying rate (currently 5.25%), or
  * your contract rate + 2%

As of November 28, 2025, the lowest available high ratio 5-year fixed rates
are at 3.79%, while the lowest variable rate available is 3.45%. Therefore,
whether you have a fixed-rate or variable-rate mortgage, the stress test used
is the contract rate + 2% (as that is higher than 5.25%).

* * *

### What is Canadian Lender and Big 6 Bank?

On our rate comparison tables, Ratehub.ca features generic brands like
“Canadian Lender”. The “Canadian Lender” rate represents the lowest rate our
brokerage can offer among the different lenders we work with. This means that
this rate can be from a Big Bank, trust company, or lending company. The
reason we do not advertise the rate under the name of the actual lender
offering it, is because the rate is only available through our brokerage, via
a special volume discount or promotion.

Similarly, “Big 6 Bank” is another generic provider that is used to advertise
the lowest Big Bank rate that the Ratehub.ca brokerage can offer.

### November 2025: Mortgage market update

Canada’s housing market faced a sharp slowdown in early 2025, as tariff
concerns and economic uncertainty kept many buyers on the sidelines. However,
affordability is improving, as home prices decline and mortgage rates continue
to fall. The Bank of Canada has now implemented a total of eight rate cuts and
three rate holds, bringing its benchmark rate to 2.50%.

If you’re looking for a mortgage rate in Canada right now, these are some
important economic factors to know.

  * **Real estate update:** Canada’s housing market posted another month of steady progress in October 2025, with national home sales rising 0.9% from September, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA). This marks the sixth gain in seven months, continuing the upward trend that began in early spring. While sales were still 4.3% lower than last October, activity remained consistent with the stronger overall performance seen throughout 2025 as easing interest rates helped bring more buyers back into the market. New listings fell 1.4% month-over-month, tightening supply at a time when demand was improving. This pushed the national sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) to 52.2%, up from 51% the month before. Although still within balanced-market territory, the gradual rise suggests buyers are experiencing slightly more competition. On the other hand, active listings were 7.2% higher than a year ago and continue to align with long-term seasonal patterns, keeping conditions stable. Months of inventory remained unchanged at 4.4 for the fourth consecutive month — the lowest level since January 2025. With the long-term national average sitting around five months, current levels indicate a balanced market that is slowly tightening as fall progresses. Home prices showed subtle signs of firming. The MLS® Home Price Index edged up 0.2% from September, while the annual decline narrowed to 3%, the smallest since March. The national average sale price reached $690,195, down 1.1% year-over-year, pointing to a market that is stabilizing after several months of downward pressure.

October](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/canadian-home-sales-rise-in-october/)

  * **CPI update:** Canada’s inflation rate eased in October to 2.2%, offering a slight relief after September’s stronger reading of 2.4% in September. The slowdown was driven mainly by a sharp drop in gas prices, which fell 9.4% compared to a 4.1% decline the previous month. Without gasoline, inflation would have registered 2.6%. The headline figure was also pushed lower by the federal government’s elimination of the consumer carbon tax earlier this year, which reduced annual inflation by an estimated 0.6%. Grocery prices contributed to the overall cooling, with food inflation easing to 3.4% from 4%. This marks the largest monthly drop in grocery inflation since 2020. Still, food prices continue to rise faster than headline inflation. Shelter costs showed mixed results: rent inflation increased to 5.2% from 4.8%, while mortgage interest costs fell again, dropping to 2.9% from 3.6% as rate cuts continue to filter through to borrowers. Insurance and telecom costs added upward pressure. Home and mortgage insurance rose 6.8% annually, auto insurance climbed 7.3%, and cellular services jumped 7.7% — the first annual increase since April 2023. Core inflation showed mild improvement. The CPI Trim edged down to 3.0% from 3.1%, while the CPI Median declined to 2.9% from 3.1%. Both measures remain slightly above where policymakers would like to see them. October data supports expectations that the Bank of Canada will continue holding its policy rate steady.

Canada rate hold](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/canadian-cpi-cools-to-2-2-in-
october/)

### **October 29, 2025, Bank of Canada announcement update**

​​On October 29, 2025, the Bank of Canada lowered its overnight rate by 25
basis points to 2.25%, its second consecutive cut following the 0.25% decrease
in September.

  * While inflation rose above the 2% target in September, the Bank believes it is stabilizing as core measures suggest growth around 2.5% and are expected to trend toward the target in the near term. However, economic growth is slowing, with unemployment steady at 7.1% in September and GDP down 1.6% in the second quarter amid ongoing trade-war disruptions.
  * The prime rate will now be lowered to 4.45%, cutting borrowing costs for variable-rate mortgages, HELOCs, and other prime-linked lending. The lowest five-year variable mortgage rate could drop from 3.70% to 3.45%, saving roughly $83 per month, or nearly $1,000 per year, on an average mortgage. 
  * Fixed mortgage rates aren’t set directly by the BoC, but are influenced by bond yields. Since the rate cut was widely anticipated, bond markets had already priced it in; as a result, five-year bond yields remained in the 2.5-2.6% range since mid-October. The [lowest five-year term](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-rates/5-year/fixed) on Ratehub.ca now sits at 3.79%, a low not seen since this past spring.
  * Savers and investors, however, will see weaker returns as deposit rates and GIC yields soften. Still, these products remain relatively stable compared to historical markets.
  * The Bank signalled it will likely hold rates in the months ahead, suggesting further rate cuts are unlikely.

### Housing market forecast for Canada for 2025

CREA has released updated forecasts showing that Canada’s housing market
recovery remains on track, though slightly slower than expected. The
association projects that 473,093 homes will be sold through MLS® Systems in
2025, a 1.1% decrease from 2024. The national average home price is expected
to dip 1.4% to $676,705, mainly due to fewer high-priced sales and declining
prices in B.C. and Ontario, despite solid growth of 4%-8% in most other
provinces. CREA attributes the softer outlook to early 2025’s “tariff chaos”
and renewed economic uncertainty, which temporarily paused buying activity
after a strong rebound began in late 2024. For 2026, CREA predicts a
significant rebound, with national sales expected to climb 7.7% to 509,479 —
the highest level since 2021 — and prices increasing 3.2% to $698,622, keeping
the national average near the $700,000 mark. While the outlook has improved,
CREA cautions that uncertainty remains elevated, though easing compared to
earlier in the year.

### Canadian mortgage reform update

On September 16, 2024, the federal government announced sweeping changes to
mortgage qualification rules for first-time home buyers, as well as those
purchasing newly-constructed homes.

**As of December 15, 2024:**

  * 30-year amortizations will be available for all first-time home buyers, regardless of whether they have an insured mortgage. These extended amortizations are also available for any purchase of new construction.  
  

  * The maximum purchase price for an insured mortgage (where less than 20% down is paid) will be increased to $1.5 million, from the current $1 million.  

These are some of the most impactful mortgage reforms announced since 2012,
and are anticipated to increase first-time home buyers’ affordability and
access to the housing market.

  * 5-year mortgage rates are driven by 5-year government bond yields  

### What makes a 5-year fixed-rate mortgage right for me?

Generally, a fixed-rate mortgage is a good choice if you are risk-averse and
don’t want to deal with the stress that could come with a variable rate if the
prime rate goes up over time and your mortgage payment increases. Before
committing to a 5-year mortgage, you need to think about your personal
situation today and going forward. If you are likely to move, change jobs, or
otherwise embark on any life changes that may affect your ability or desire to
remain in the home you are purchasing, you need to take this into account when
selecting the mortgage that’s right for you.

#### **Full feature mortgages vs. restricted mortgages**

While it’s always desirable to obtain the best mortgage rate, in today’s
historically high rate environment, the quest to find the lowest rate seems
more important than ever. It also means that one needs to be vigilant about
choosing the right mortgage for your needs. The lowest rate that you see
advertised may not be what you want, because it could well be for a restricted
mortgage. Although the low rates of a restricted mortgage may catch your eye,
it’s important to understand the drawbacks. A full feature mortgage will have
a higher interest rate, but it will also have a number of features that make
it very desirable, including:

  * **Pre-payment options:** Take a look at what [pre-payment options](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-pre-payment) your lender is willing to offer you. The more flexible your lender is with pre-payment options, the faster you can potentially pay off your loan, which could save you thousands of dollars in interest fees. The main pre-payment options are monthly pre-payment and lump sum pre-payment. In the case of the former, you’re allowed to increase your monthly payment up to a certain percentage determined by your lender, maxing out at 100%. If you had a lender who was flexible enough to allow you to double your monthly payments, for example, you could in theory pay your mortgage off in half the time if you were able to do so. The latter option, lump sum pre-payment, allows you to pay off up to say, 25% of your mortgage loan, again, depending on your lender.
  * **Porting your mortgage:** If you need to sell your home before the end of your mortgage term, many lenders will allow you to [port your mortgage](https://www.ratehub.ca/porting-and-assuming-your-mortgage). Porting a mortgage means to take your current mortgage with its existing rates and terms and transfer it to another property, and allows you to avoid breaking your mortgage. You’ll want to talk to your lender about how portable your mortgage is, particularly if you think you may need to move before your term is up. Not all mortgages are portable, and many that are portable have conditions attached that you should be aware of.
  * **Lump sum pre-payment privileges:** You are allowed to make multiple lump sum pre-payments to bring down your mortgage balance in a given calendar year. Most lenders will cap the amount of pre-payments you can make, e.g. you cannot pay more than 20% of your principal in a single year.
  * **Payment flexibility:** If you choose to increase the size of your regular mortgage payments, you are able to do so without incurring any penalties or fees. 

These are just some of the most common features you’ll find in a full feature
mortgage that make them so convenient for homebuyers. To learn more about the
mortgage that’s right for you, it’s always a good idea to speak with a
[mortgage broker](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-brokers-canada). They can
give you personalized, expert advice at no cost to you.  

### What are some of the pros and cons of a 5-year fixed mortgage?

There are pros and cons to choosing a 5-year fixed mortgage rate, and we’ll
walk you through each below. Some of the pros of a 5-year fixed mortgage are:

  * **Risk protection:** For buyers who are risk-averse; a fixed rate mortgage enables you to “set it and forget it” - your rate, and therefore mortgage payment, is locked in and will not fluctuate with changes in bond yields. This allows you to budget with greater accuracy and offers you stability for the duration of your term. Moreover, in recent years, Canadians enjoyed access to some of the [best fixed rates available in decades](https://www.ratehub.ca/5-year-fixed-mortgage-rate-history), although fixed rates started to climb again in October of 2021. Since then, high inflation, global banking instability, an incredibly tight job market and other factors have all pushed bond yields up, and with them, fixed mortgage rates. Today’s fixed rates are now higher than they have been since back in 2009.
  * **Competitive rates:** The 5-year term is historically the most popular option, and the one that lenders often encourage you to opt for. The length of this term is a good “middle of the road” choice for home buyers. Because it’s such a competitive, popular rate term, lenders often get the most aggressive when pricing these terms.

On the flip side, there are some cons to consider as well.

  * **Higher rates:** In order to guarantee your fixed rate, your lender will charge you a premium. According to York University Professor Moshe Milevsky’s landmark 2001 [study](https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/cim/financial_math/00-01/mac_risk_conf/moshe_milevsky.pdf), historically, over 90% of Canadians who have maintained a variable mortgage rate throughout their entire mortgage term have paid less in interest than those who have stuck to a fixed rate.
  * **Breakage penalties:** While the 5-year term can offer you peace of mind, in the event that something such as a move, loss of a job, illness or divorce forces you to break your mortgage, you could be on the hook for a hefty break penalty. With a fixed mortgage rate, your penalty will be the greater of the interest rate differential (IRD) or three months’ interest. Oftentimes, the IRD penalty can be large, and thus a fixed rate mortgage can be expensive to break. If you have a variable rate mortgage, on the other hand, the penalty will always be three months’ interest, and it can therefore be less costly to break your mortgage. For a more detailed explanation of IRD and how it is calculated, you can refer to our [Mortgage Refinance Calculator page](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-refinance-penalty). You can also use our [Mortgage Penalty Calculator](https://www.ratehub.ca/penalty-calculator) to estimate how much you might have to pay in the event that you have to break your mortgage.

whether rates are currently higher or lower than they have been in the past.

### The popularity of 5-year fixed mortgage rates

A 5-year mortgage term is the most popular duration. It sits right in the
middle of available mortgage term lengths, between one and 10 years, and,
thus, its popularity reflects a risk-neutral average. It also tends to be
heavily promoted by major lenders. A further breakdown of mortgage terms shows
that about 80% of mortgages have terms of five years or less.

Fixed rates are by far the most common - in 2023, from January to December,
almost 95% of mortgage rate inquiries made to Ratehub.ca were for fixed rates.
Moreover, according to the [2024 CMHC Mortgage Consumer
Survey](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-
research/housing-research/surveys/mortgage-consumer-
surveys/-/media/1b29e28201c54c6f8e9b9e4056cc6d4f.ashx), 69% of all mortgages
contracted in 2024 were for fixed-rate mortgages. The table below, sourced
from the same survey, shows the popularity of fixed-rate mortgages in 2024
among the four main categories of people who contracted mortgages.  

**First-time home buyers** | **Repeat buyers** | **Renewers** | **Refinancers**  
---|---|---|---  
71% | 75% | 71% | 60%  
  
### What drives changes in 5-year fixed mortgage rates?

By and large, 5-year fixed mortgage rates follow the pattern of 5-year Canada
Bond Yields, plus a spread. Bond yields are driven by economic factors such as
unemployment, export and inflation.

When Canada Bond Yields rise, sourcing capital to fund mortgages becomes more
costly for mortgage lenders and their profit is reduced unless they raise
mortgage rates. The reverse is true when market conditions are good.

In terms of the spread between the mortgage rates and the bond yields,
mortgage lenders set this based on their desired market share, competition,
marketing strategy and general credit market conditions.
