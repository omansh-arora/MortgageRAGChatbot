###  [Housing Affordability and Parental Income
Support](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2024/07/staff-working-paper-2024-28/)

Staff Working Paper 2024-28 [Jason
Allen](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/jason-allen/), [Kyra

Financial Stability, Financial Studies"), [Nicolas
Vincent](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/nicolas-vincent/ "External Deputy
Governor")

In many countries, the cost of housing has greatly outpaced income growth,
leading to a housing affordability crisis. Leveraging Canadian loan-level data
and quasi-experimental variation in payment-to-income constraints, we document
an increasing reliance of first-time homebuyers on financial help from their
parents, through mortgage co-signing. We show that parental support can
effectively relax borrowing constraints—potentially to riskier borrowers.

###  [Debt-Relief Programs and Money Left on the Table: Evidence from Canada's
Response to COVID-19](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2021/03/staff-working-
paper-2021-13/)

Staff Working Paper 2021-13 [Jason
Allen](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/jason-allen/), [Robert

Li](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/shaoteng-li/ "Senior Economist -

Vincent](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/nicolas-vincent/ "External Deputy
Governor")

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Canadian financial institutions offered debt-
relief programs to help borrowers cope with job losses and economic
insecurity. We consider the low take-up rates for these programs and suggest
that to be effective, such programs must be visible and easy to use.

###  [On the Importance of Sales for Aggregate Price
Flexibility](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2014/10/working-paper-2014-45/)

Staff Working Paper 2014-45 [Oleksiy
Kryvtsov](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/oleksiy-kryvtsov/ "Senior
Research Officer - Economic and Financial Research"), [Nicolas
Vincent](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/profile/nicolas-vincent/ "External Deputy
Governor")

Macroeconomists have traditionally ignored the behavior of temporary price
markdowns (“sales”) by retailers. Although sales are common in the micro price
data, they are assumed to be unrelated to macroeconomic phenomena and
generally filtered out.
