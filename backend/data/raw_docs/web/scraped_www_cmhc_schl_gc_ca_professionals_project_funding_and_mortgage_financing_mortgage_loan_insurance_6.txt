[Visual: Multiple historical, black-and-white photos flash by rapidly on
screen, showing houses, buildings and people in offices and at outdoor events.
The final screen shows colour images of the CMHC building and logo, with the
text “CMHC Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, SCHL Société Canadienne
d’hypothèques et de logement” and the Canada Wordmark (the Government of
Canada logo) on the side.]

00:00:03 **Narrator:** We are Canada’s first mortgage loan insurance provider.
00:00:07

00:00:04 – 00:00:07

[Visual: Various images flash on screen, showing different scenes inside an
office building: a person walking along a hallway reading documents, a woman
walking down the hall looking at her phone, a woman and man having a
discussion as they walk, a closeup from behind of a person carrying a
briefcase, then a woman walking into a boardroom full of people.]

We have over 70 years of experience designing and delivering industry-leading
products, services and market analysis. 00:00:16

00:00:08 – 00:00:16

[Visual: The text “Over 70 years of experience.” appears in blue on a white
background.  
Screen transitions to a boardroom with large windows, where four people are
having a meeting. Screen transitions to two men looking at a computer screen
together, then to a closeup of the Google search homepage, with the words
“industry-leading products” being typed into the search field. The image
changes to rapidly zoom in on a CMHC webpage with the heading “Get in touch”
and text below, which is only partially visible, and starts with “Contact us
for more details on our full range of programs.” The cursor clicks on the
“Contact” button below the text. The screen transitions, and the text “Market
Analysis” appears in the middle of the screen, over a background image of a
laptop sitting on a desk with a cup of coffee. The laptop is open to a webpage
titled “CMHC’s Mortgage Loan Insurance Products.” Someone reaches out from the
left side of the screen to close the laptop.]

We can process a homeowner’s mortgage insurance application in seconds with
our online application system, saving you time and money. 00:00:26

00:00:17 – 00:00:26

[Visual: View from above of a person opening a laptop that’s sitting on a
round table with a notebook and two cellphones. Video transitions to a woman
and a man in business attire sitting at a table and looking at a document
together while smiling. Next, a closeup shows a person’s hand scrolling on a
tablet screen. The text “Access to largest database of properties” appears on
screen as the video transitions to a closeup of a person’s hands typing on a
keyboard. The closeup zooms out as the text disappears, and the video
transitions to a woman walking down the street while looking at her phone and
smiling.]

00:00:26 – 00:00:28

[Visual: Rapid succession of images while music plays in the background with
no voiceover, showing a closeup of a Canadian flag waving in the wind, a beach
at sunset with people walking along the shore, then Toronto’s downtown skyline
with the CN Tower at the lake’s edge.]

Our products are available for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, no
matter their location. 00:00:35

00:00:29 – 00:00:36

[Visual: A group of workers building a house in a forested area, then a
closeup of a person working under the eaves of a new log house. Screen
transitions quickly to a wide-angle view of tree trunks in an old-growth
forest, then a group of coloured houses along the shore at the edge of a steep
cliff, ending with a view across a snowy, mountainous northern landscape.
Video transitions to an aerial view of a town in a forested area in autumn,
with snow-capped mountains in the distance. Next, the video flashes to another
aerial shot of a forested area in autumn, with the sun setting behind the
hills as a lone car drives along a rural highway. Video transitions to a view
of a city skyline along a waterway where multiple sailboats are moored, then
transitions briefly to an aerial view of a wide water channel with buildings
on either side and a small ferry boat crossing the channel.]

As the only provider of multi-unit insurance, we also have a unique view into
the rental market, offering valuable insights to support your business
objectives. 00:00:47

00:00:37 – 00:00:46

[Visual: The screen transitions, and the text “Only provider of mortgage loan
insurance for multi-unit residential properties.” appears in blue on a white
background. The text disappears, and the video transitions to show two multi-
unit residential buildings with a construction crane in the background. Video
transitions to a construction site in a forested area, with three single-
storey houses, one nearly complete, the two others still under construction.
Video transitions to a slowly spinning aerial view of a house in the early
stages of construction, in the middle of a gravel area. Video transitions to
show three women and two men standing around a table in a windowed office
meeting room. The image transitions to a closeup of the same five people
standing around the meeting room table.]

We have decades of expertise and a deep understanding of the market,
perfecting the tools and services you need to stay one step ahead. 00:00:56

00:00:47 – 00:00:56

[Visual: A series of black-and-white, then colour photos of various houses and
buildings appears rapidly on a black background, piling up on each other as
they appear. Then the screen transitions rapidly between several images
showing momentary closeups of different individual men and women in various
locations, each looking into the camera. Screen transitions to a closeup from
behind of a person looking at a computer screen showing columns of data and
with multiple sticky notes along the screen rim. Screen transitions to show
the words “Tools and Services” being typed into a blue search field on a white
background. Then the image zooms out rapidly, and a blue button with the text
“Ready?” appears below the search field. The cursor moves up and clicks on the
word “Ready?” The screen transitions to show a group of two men and two women
in business attire standing together and looking into the camera. The text
“One step ahead.” appears on screen, superimposed on the four people.]

00:00:57 – 00:01:06

[Visual: Screen transitions to a white background showing the CMHC SCHL logo
at the centre of the screen. The logo slides to the right, and the Canada
Wordmark (the Government of Canada logo) appears on the left. Both logos
remain on screen as the music continues to play. The screen slowly fades to
black.]
