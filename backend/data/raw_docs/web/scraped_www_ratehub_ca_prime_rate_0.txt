# Prime rate in Canada

[Jamie David, Sr. Director of Marketing and MortgagesNovember 23,
2025](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-rates)

## Key Takeaways

  1. Canada's prime rate as of today is currently at 4.45%, influenced by the Bank of Canada's policy interest rate, also known as the target for the overnight rate.
  2. The prime rate impacts variable loans and lines of credit, including variable-rate mortgages. When the Bank of Canada changes its overnight rate, lenders typically adjust their prime rates accordingly.
  3. The housing market saw a dip in activity in October, with home sales dropping by 4.3% from the same time last year. 

The prime rate in Canada today, November 28, 2025, is currently 4.45%. The
prime rate, also known as the prime lending rate, is the annual interest rate
Canada’s major banks and financial institutions use to set interest rates for
variable loans and lines of credit, including variable-rate mortgages.

## What is the prime rate?

When you apply for a loan with a variable interest rate, your lender will give
you an annual interest rate that’s tied to the bank’s prime rate. All kinds of
loans are based on this rate, including certain mortgages, car loans, personal
lines of credit, and even some credit cards. Think of the prime rate as the
anchor these other interest rates are based on. As the prime rate in Canada
moves up or down, so too does the rate of interest you pay on your loan.

## November 2025: Mortgage market update

The Bank of Canada (BoC) cut its overnight lending rate to 2.25% on October
29, 2025. This marks its second consecutive cut following the quarter-point
decrease from September. As a result of the drop, Canada’s prime rate will
decrease to 4.45%, reducing borrowing costs for variable-rate mortgages,
HELOCs, and other prime-linked products.

  * **Real estate update:** Canada’s housing market continued to firm up in October 2025, with national home sales rising 0.9% from September, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA). This marks the sixth increase in the past seven months, extending the steady momentum that began in early spring. While activity remained 4.3% below last October’s levels, the overall pace of sales has held consistently stronger throughout 2025. New listings pulled back 1.4% month-over-month, tightening supply conditions at a time when demand is improving. With sales increasing and fewer homes hitting the market, the national sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) climbed to 52.2%, up from 51% in September. The ratio remains within balanced-market territory, but the upward trend points to slowly rising competition, even as active listings stay 7.2% higher than a year ago and close to long-term norms. Inventory held steady for the fourth consecutive month at 4.4 months, the lowest level since January 2025. Home prices also showed signs of stabilization. The MLS® Home Price Index inched up 0.2% month-over-month, while annual prices were down 3% — the smallest decline since March. The national average sale price reached $690,195, a 1.1% decrease from October 2024. Although still below last year’s levels, the combination of firmer monthly gains and narrowing annual declines suggests the market is beginning to find its footing after a soft period earlier in the year.

  * **CPI update:** ****Statistics Canada reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.2% year over year in October, down from 2.4% in the previous month. The headline slowdown was driven mainly by a sharp 9.4% annual drop in gasoline prices. Without gas, inflation would have been higher at 2.6%, underscoring that much of the softness came from a single category. Grocery inflation provided another source of relief, slowing to 3.4% from 4% in September, marking its steepest monthly cooling since 2020. Shelter categories moved in different directions. Mortgage interest costs continued their steady decline, falling to 2.9% from 3.6%. Rent inflation, however, accelerated to 5.2% from 4.8%. Households also faced stronger price pressures for insurance and wireless services. Home and mortgage insurance rose 6.8%, auto insurance climbed 7.3%, and cellular services jumped 7.7% as major carriers increased plan prices. Canada’s core inflation measures showed slight improvement. The CPI Median eased to 2.9% from 3.1%, while the CPI Trim dipped to 3.0% from 3.1%. Both sit within the Bank’s 1–3% target band, though still somewhat too elevated to signal clear progress on underlying inflation. Altogether, October’s report strengthens expectations that the Bank of Canada will maintain its rate hold.

## Canada housing market forecast for 2025

CREA has adjusted its housing market forecast for 2025 and 2026, showing that
Canada’s market recovery is continuing, though more gradually than
anticipated. After signs of renewed strength in late 2024, early 2025 brought
fresh challenges, including tariff-related disruptions and broader economic
uncertainty, that temporarily slowed buyer activity. Still, sales have been
trending upward since March 2025, reflecting renewed confidence among buyers.
CREA now projects 473,093 home sales in 2025, down 1.1% from the previous
year. The national average home price is forecast to dip 1.4% to $676,705,
largely due to fewer high-value transactions in major markets like B.C. and
Ontario, even as most other provinces experience price growth between 4% and
8%. By 2026, CREA expects a stronger rebound, with sales projected to rise
7.7% to 509,479 — the most since 2021 — and the average home price to climb
3.2% to $698,622, bringing the market back toward its $700,000 norm.

## WATCH: October 29, 2025 Bank of Canada announcement

### Canadian mortgage reform update

On September 16, 2024, the federal government announced sweeping changes to
mortgage qualification rules for first-time home buyers, as well as those
purchasing newly-constructed homes.

**As of December 15, 2024:**

  * 30-year amortizations will be available for all first-time home buyers, regardless of whether they have an insured mortgage. These extended amortizations are also available for any purchase of new construction.  
  

  * The maximum purchase price for an insured mortgage (where less than 20% down is paid) will be increased to $1.5 million, from the current $1 million.  

These are some of the most impactful mortgage reforms announced since 2012,
and are anticipated to increase first-time home buyers’ affordability and
access to the housing market.

## How is the prime rate set in Canada?

Each bank sets its own prime rate, but the Big Five Banks usually all have the
same prime rate. The prime rate is primarily influenced by the policy interest
rate set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), also known as the BoC's target for the
overnight rate. When the BoC raises the overnight rate, it becomes more
expensive for banks to borrow money, and they raise their respective prime
rates to cover the added costs. Conversely when the BoC lowers the overnight
rate, banks usually lower their prime rates by the same amount.

### Is the prime rate going up in Canada?

From early 2022 to the first half of 2023, the prime rate steadily increased
in response to the Bank of Canada’s efforts to control high inflation. During
this period, the Bank of Canada implemented a series of 10 rate hikes, pushing
its Overnight Lending Rate to 5% by mid-2023. This resulted in the prime rate
rising to 7.2%.

However, the trend reversed in June 2024. Between then and March 2025, the
Bank delivered seven consecutive cuts, bringing its benchmark rate down from
5% to 2.75%. After holding steady at that level through the spring and summer,
the Bank cut again on September 17, 2025, lowering the overnight rate to
2.50%. This recent October cut brings the rate back down to 2.25%, decreasing
Canada’s prime rate to 4.45% providing further relief for variable-rate
borrowers.

## How does the prime rate affect mortgage rates in Canada?

There are two main types of mortgage rates in Canada – fixed and variable.
When you get a fixed mortgage rate, you agree to pay the same rate over the
entire course of your mortgage term regardless of what happens in the outside
market. Fixed mortgages are a good option if you’re worried mortgage rates
will go up, or if you want to enjoy the stability of paying the same mortgage
rate until it’s time to renew.

When you get a variable mortgage rate, the rate will be expressed as the prime
rate plus or minus a certain percentage. When the prime rate in Canada goes up
or down, your mortgage rate will go up or down by the same amount. Variable
mortgages usually come with a lower rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages when you
sign up, but there’s the risk that the rate could go up (or down) during your
mortgage term. Many lenders will allow you to convert a variable-rate mortgage
to a fixed-rate mortgage at any time, but you will have to pay the fixed rate
as of the time you decide to switch.

Let’s look at an example. If the prime rate is 3.0%, and you get a variable-
rate mortgage at prime minus 0.8%, your effective interest rate will be 2.2%.

**Example 1: Your original mortgage rate**

prime rate**-** discount to prime rate**=** your mortgage rate

**3.00%** -**0.80%** = **2.20%**

The prime rate can rise and fall over time, and variable-rate loans will rise
and fall with it. To continue this example, if the prime rate were to increase
by 0.25% to 3.25%, the interest rate on your mortgage would rise by the same
amount, to 2.45%.

**Example 2: Your new rate after prime rate increases during your mortgage
term**

new prime rate - discount to prime rate = your new mortgage rate

**3.25% - 0.80% = 2.45% (new mortgage rate)**

### What is the prime rate vs. Bank of Canada rate?

The Bank of Canada’s rate, also referred to as the overnight rate, policy
rate, or key interest rate, is the rate at which financial institutions borrow
funds from one another (and sometimes from the Bank of Canada) for short-term
needs. This rate is the Bank’s main tool for steering borrowing costs,
influencing economic growth, and managing inflation.

The prime rate, on the other hand, is set independently by each financial
institution. However, it closely follows the Bank of Canada’s key interest
rate. When the Bank of Canada raises or lowers its rate, banks generally
adjust their prime rates in the same direction. This directly impacts the
interest costs for variable-rate products, such as variable-rate mortgages,
home equity lines of credit, and some personal or business loans.

* * *

### How is the prime rate related to the Bank of Canada’s key interest rate?

Banks and other lenders borrow money from various sources, including the Bank
of Canada itself (through its lending facilities), and from one another in the
overnight market. When the Bank of Canada raises the cost of borrowing in
these markets by increasing its target for the overnight rate, it becomes more
expensive for financial institutions to obtain the funds they lend out to
consumers and businesses. They respond by raising their prime lending rates to
cover the increased costs.

Conversely, when the Bank of Canada lowers its policy interest rate, borrowing
becomes cheaper for banks and lenders, and they typically reduce their prime
rates accordingly.

* * *

### What will the prime rate in Canada be in 2025?

As of October 2025, the prime rate in Canada is 4.45%, following the Bank of
Canada’s decision to lower its overnight lending rate to 2.25%. This comes
after a series of seven rate cuts between June 2024 and March 2025 that
reduced the benchmark rate from 5% to 2.75%, three subsequent holds through
the spring and summer, and an additional 25-basis-point cut in September.

The Bank’s October cut was prompted by a struggling economy, including a 7.1%
unemployment rate, slowing GDP growth, and a rising inflation rate, which is
expected to stabilize. Looking ahead, the prime rate could shift further
depending on how trade disruptions, tariffs, and inflation pressures evolve in
the coming months.

* * *

### Does the prime rate affect mortgage rates?

Yes, especially for variable-rate mortgages. Variable rates are usually set at
prime plus or minus a certain percentage. When the prime rate goes up, so does
the interest rate for a variable mortgage, and vice versa. Fixed mortgage
rates, on the other hand, are more influenced by bond market movements rather
than the prime rate.

* * *

### Do all banks have the same prime rate?

Technically, each financial institution sets its own prime rate, and there’s
no requirement for banks to have a uniform rate. However, in practice, the
prime rates offered by Canada’s major banks are usually identical or very
close. This happens because banks tend to follow the Bank of Canada’s changes
to the overnight rate in tandem, and they also monitor each other to stay
competitive.
