# Policy interest rate

The Bank carries out monetary policy by influencing short-term interest rates.
It does this by adjusting the target for the overnight rate  on eight fixed
dates each year.

For more information on the policy interest rate, see this
[explainer](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/06/understanding-policy-interest-
rate/).
