### Why should I compare mortgage rates?

Not all mortgage rates are created equal. In addition to the different
interest rates out there, mortgages also vary with what’s offered in their
terms and conditions. Each mortgage caters to an individual's particular
needs. If you want to find the best mortgage rate and product for you, you
need to compare all of your options, and the best way to do that is to talk to
a mortgage broker.

### What is the difference between a fixed vs. a variable mortgage rate?

If you choose to get a fixed mortgage rate, your mortgage rate – and,
therefore, your mortgage payment – stays the same throughout your entire
mortgage term. If you’re risk-averse and/or just feel more comfortable knowing
how much you’ll need to budget for each month, you should consider getting a
fixed mortgage rate – but know that the security comes with a premium, in the
form of a higher interest rate. Of all the mortgages in Canada, 66% currently
have fixed rates.

Variable mortgage rates, on the other hand, are historically lower than fixed
rates but can vary throughout the duration of your mortgage term. Variable
rates are attached to Prime, so if Prime fluctuates up or down, so does your
mortgage rate – and, therefore, your mortgage payment. If you’re comfortable
taking on some risk, a variable mortgage rate could potentially save you a lot
of money throughout the life of your mortgage. Of all the mortgages in Canada,
26% currently have variable rates.

### Should I get an open or closed mortgage?

If you’re thinking of moving soon, or if you’re expecting a lump sum of money
from an inheritance or bonus, you may want to consider an open mortgage. With
an open mortgage, you are able to pay off the entire balance of your mortgage
at any time throughout your term – without penalty. The downside is that you
have to pay a premium for this option, which comes in the form of a higher
interest rate.

Closed mortgages, on the other hand, are the more popular option chosen by
Canadian homebuyers, because the interest rates are much lower. With a closed
mortgage, the one restriction is that you’re only allowed to pay down a
certain amount of your principal each year, as defined in the prepayment
options of your mortgage contract. If you pay off the entire balance before
your term is up, you’ll be hit with a prepayment penalty.

### How often are Ratehub.ca mortgage rates updated?

The mortgage rates you see were updated today. Our mortgage rates are sourced
two ways: mortgage brokers can log into our website and update their rates,
and we automatically update all the rates found on the websites of Canadian
banks.

### What is a rate hold?

A rate hold is a time period (typically 30-120 days) during which you can lock
in the current best mortgage rate. If rates go down during this time, most
lenders will honour the lower rate.
