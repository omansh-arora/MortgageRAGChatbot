of 2025 https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/10/business-outlook-survey-third-
quarter-of-2025/ Results from the Business Outlook Survey and the Business
Leaders’ Pulse reveal that firms’ outlooks and intentions remain subdued
despite a gradual improvement in sentiment. Expectations for growth in
domestic and export sales are still soft. Most firms do not plan to increase
staffing, and investment intentions are restrained. While businesses continue
to expect cost increases from tariffs and trade uncertainty, weak demand
limits their ability to pass these costs through to prices. One-year-ahead
inflation expectations remain below the peak reached earlier in the trade
conflict. 2025-10-20T10:30:25+00:00 en Business Outlook Survey—Third Quarter

2025 https://www.bankofcanada.ca/2025/10/canadian-survey-of-consumer-
expectations-third-quarter-of-2025/ Results of the third-quarter 2025 survey
show that tariffs and trade tensions continue to affect consumers' perceptions
about their financial health and spending plans. The CSCE indicator rose
modestly from its most recent low, improved by slight gains in financial
health and household spending intentions. But perceptions of labour market
conditions deteriorated further, driven in part by a sharp drop in job-finding
prospects for public sector workers. Consumers’ short-term inflation
expectations remain above their pre-pandemic averages, and expectations for
longer-term inflation have picked up again. 2025-10-20T10:30:11+00:00 en
