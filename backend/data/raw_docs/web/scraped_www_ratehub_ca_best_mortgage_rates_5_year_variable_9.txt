### What is the best 5-year variable mortgage rate in Canada?

As of November 28, 2025, the best high-ratio, 5-year variable rate in Canada
was 3.45%. To see today's rates, visit our rate table to see the 5-year
variable mortgage rates offered by Canada’s Big Banks and top lenders.

### What is the average interest rate for a 5-year variable mortgage?

As of October 30, 2025, the average of the Big 5 Banks’ best high-ratio,
5-year variable mortgage rates is 4.08%.

* * *

### Will variable mortgage rates go down in 2025?

Variable mortgage rates are closely tied to the Bank of Canada’s overnight
lending rate, which directly influences the prime rate set by lenders. In
October’s announcement, the Bank lowered its overnight rate by 25 basis
points, bringing it down to 2.25% – the lowest level since July 2022. This
move lowered the prime rate to 4.45%, which has already translated into
reduced borrowing costs for variable-rate mortgage holders. As a result, the
best five-year variable rate has dropped to 3.45%, down from 3.70% before the
cut. Whether variable rates decline further will depend on upcoming economic
data. However, the Bank has signalled it will hold rates for the coming
months. For borrowers, this means variable rates are once again priced below
fixed options, but the outlook remains uncertain.

* * *

### When should I switch from a variable to a fixed mortgage?

Switching from a variable to a [fixed mortgage](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-
mortgage-rates/5-year/fixed) depends on your personal financial situation,
risk tolerance, and how current rates compare to your existing mortgage. As of
October 2025, the Bank of Canada has lowered its policy rate to 2.25%, marking
its second consecutive rate cut, bringing the prime rate down to 4.45%. This
has pushed variable mortgage rates below fixed options, with the best five-
year variable around 3.45% compared to roughly 3.70% for the best five-year
fixed.

Before [switching your mortgage](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/should-you-
switch-from-variable-to-fixed/), assess the spread between your current
variable rate and the best fixed rate available today. If today’s fixed rates
are higher than your current rate, and further BoC cuts are expected, staying
the course may be more cost-effective. If the savings outweigh the potential
for further prime rate cuts, switching might make sense. Before making the
switch, consider the cost of breaking your current mortgage. You can use
[Ratehub’s penalty calculator](https://www.ratehub.ca/penalty-calculator) to
help you estimate this cost.

Read: [Should you switch from a variable-rate to a fixed-rate
mortgage?](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/should-you-switch-from-variable-to-
fixed/)

If the spread between your current rate and the best fixed rate is greater
than the expected increases in the prime rate, you may benefit from sticking
with your current variable rate. However, if the best available variable rate
offers a larger discount to prime than your current rate, switching to a new
variable rate could provide more savings and a greater buffer against
potential future rate hikes.  
  
Before making the switch, consider the cost of breaking your current mortgage.
You can use [Ratehub’s penalty calculator](https://www.ratehub.ca/penalty-
calculator) to help you estimate this cost.

Finally, if you’re concerned about rising monthly payments, some variable-rate
mortgages offer fixed-payment schedules. In these cases, even if the prime
rate rises, your monthly payment remains the same, but more of it goes toward
paying interest rather than reducing your principal, and ultimately, it may
take you longer to pay back your mortgage amount. That said, you should be
aware that these types of mortgages are subject to hitting the trigger rate,
wherein your payments are no longer going to the principal and may not even be
covering the costs of interest in full. Once this happens, you go into
‘negative amortization,’ where you are actually losing equity that you’ve
built up in your home. This can lead to you reaching your trigger point, where
your payments are less than the cost of interest on your mortgage loan, so
you’ll need to increase them. While this risk is lower in the current
environment, it’s something to consider, especially given that many borrowers
faced trigger rate issues during the Bank of Canada's rate hikes in 2022-2023.

* * *

### Is it worth getting a variable-rate mortgage now?

Whether or not a variable-rate mortgage is right for you depends on your risk
tolerance as a borrower. Variable rates fluctuate with the Bank of Canada’s
Overnight Lending Rate, meaning your interest rate and, in turn, your payments
could increase if rates rise. For variable mortgage borrowers with fixed-
payment schedules, rising rates could reduce the portion of payments going
toward the principal, potentially leading to a trigger rate and negative
amortization.

That said, the rate environment has shifted since mid-2024. From June 2024 to
March 2025, the Bank of Canada implemented seven rate cuts, lowering the
overnight rate by 225 basis points to 2.75%, bringing the prime rate down to
4.95%. In its latest announcement on July 30, 2025, the Bank held rates
steady, citing persistent core inflation (now above 3%) and uncertainty tied
to U.S. tariffs. This means borrowing costs for variable-rate mortgage
products are likely to remain stable in the near term.

The lowest available five-year variable rate is currently 3.95%, slightly
higher than the best fixed rate, which sits at 3.89%.

### What is the stress test for a mortgage with a variable rate

The [mortgage stress test](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/how-to-stress-test-
your-mortgage/) ensures borrowers can handle their payments if rates increase.
For variable-rate mortgages, borrowers must qualify at the higher of:

  1. The Bank of Canada’s qualifying rate (currently 5.25%), or
  2. Your contract rate + 2%.

As of October 29, 2025, the lowest 5-year variable rate in Canada is 3.45%.
Since adding 2% to this rate (5.45%) exceeds the qualifying rate, most
borrowers are stress tested at their contract rate + 2%.

### What is Canadian Lender and Big 6 Bank?

On our rate comparison tables, Ratehub.ca features generic brands like
“Canadian Lender”. The “Canadian Lender” rate represents the lowest rate our
brokerage can offer among the different lenders we work with. This means that
this rate can be from a Big Bank, trust company, or lending company. The
reason we do not advertise the rate under the name of the actual lender
offering it, is because the rate is only available through our brokerage, via
a special volume discount or promotion.

Similarly, “Big 6 Bank” is another generic provider that is used to advertise
the lowest Big Bank rate that the Ratehub.ca brokerage can offer.

### November 2025: Mortgage market update

The housing market in Canada saw a rather quiet start to 2025, as buyers
stayed on the sidelines. When looked at from a historical perspective, both
fixed and variable mortgage rates are currently elevated. Anyone shopping for
a mortgage rate in Canada today should be aware of the economic factors below.

  * **Real estate update:** Canada’s housing market gained further traction in October 2025, with national home sales rising 0.9% from September, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA). This marks the sixth increase in seven months, reflecting a steady recovery that began in early spring. Although sales were 4.3% lower than the same month last year, activity continued to align with the stronger conditions seen throughout 2025. New listings fell 1.4% month-over-month, narrowing supply just as demand improved. As a result, the national sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) edged up to 52.2%, compared to 51% in September. While this still reflects balanced conditions, the upward trend indicates that buyers are encountering slightly more competition than earlier in the year. Despite this shift, active listings remained 7.2% higher than last October, helping keep the market from tipping into seller-favoured territory. Months of inventory held steady at 4.4 for the fourth consecutive month — the lowest level since January 2025. Price trends showed early signs of stabilization. The MLS® Home Price Index rose 0.2% month-over-month, with the annual decline narrowing to 3%, the smallest drop since March. The national average sale price reached $690,195, down 1.1% year-over-year. Although prices remain lower than last year, consecutive monthly gains and smaller annual declines suggest the market may be approaching a turning point heading into 2026.

October](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/canadian-home-sales-rise-in-october/)

  * **CPI update:** ****Canada’s inflation rate edged lower in October, providing some relief after September’s jump but still signalling that underlying price pressures remain sticky. Statistics Canada reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.2% year over year, down from 2.4% the month before. Much of the deceleration came from a sizeable drop in gasoline prices, which fell 9.4% compared to last year. The headline figure also continued to reflect the impact of the federal government’s removal of the consumer carbon tax in April. Food and shelter costs showed a mixed performance. Grocery price growth slowed meaningfully, falling to 3.4% from 4% in September, the largest monthly moderation since 2020. Despite the improvement, food prices are still rising faster than the overall CPI. Rent inflation moved higher, climbing to 5.2% from 4.8%, while declining interest rates helped ease mortgage interest costs for homeowners, pushing that measure down to 2.9% from 3.6%. Core inflation saw modest declines, with the CPI Median falling to 2.9% and the CPI Trim edging down to 3.0%. Although both measures remain within the Bank’s 1–3% target band, they continue to hover slightly above the levels policymakers would prefer, suggesting that broad-based easing has yet to take hold. While the headline number moved closer to the Bank’s target, the underlying details, particularly persistent strength in shelter, insurance, and telecom costs, indicate that inflation is cooling unevenly.

Canada rate hold](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/canadian-cpi-cools-to-2-2-in-
october/)

### **October 29, 2025, Bank of Canada announcement update**

On October 29, 2025, the Bank of Canada reduced its overnight rate by 25 basis
points to 2.25%, the lowest level in more than three years.

  * The central bank said the decision was driven by signs of sluggish economic growth and stabilizing inflation pressures. The unemployment rate remained at 7.1% in September, and GDP contracted by 1.6% in the second quarter of the year due to tariffs. Inflation rose to 2.4% year-over-year in September, but the Bank believes the core measures show growth of around 2.5%, which it expects to ease within the Bank’s 2% target within the near term.
  * The cut will lower the prime rate to 4.45%, providing immediate relief for borrowers with variable-rate mortgages, HELOCs, and other credit products tied to prime. For mortgage holders, the best five-year variable rate is expected to fall from 3.70% to 3.45%, creating potential savings of just under $1,000 annually on a typical loan. 
  * Fixed mortgage rates are also edging lower as bond yields decline, with the best five-year fixed currently at 3.79% on Ratehub.ca, a low not seen since Spring. 
  * For savers and investors, today’s cut means lower returns on deposit products such as high-interest savings accounts and GICs. However, these products still remain relatively safe options in an uncertain market environment.
  * Looking ahead, further drops are unlikely as the Bank has indicated it will hold rates in future months.

### Forecast for 2025 housing market

CREA has revised its housing market outlook, forecasting a slower but steady
recovery over the next two years. Following a rebound that began in late 2024,
the market was briefly disrupted in early 2025 by economic uncertainty and
tariff-related challenges that cooled buyer confidence. Despite that setback,
sales activity has been climbing consistently since March 2025, indicating
that demand is resurging. CREA now expects 473,093 homes to be sold in 2025,
representing a slight 1.1% decline from last year, and forecasts the national
average home price will edge down 1.4% to $676,705. The association
anticipates a more robust rebound in 2026, with national sales projected to
rise 7.7% to 509,479 — nearing the symbolic half-million mark for just the
eighth time in history — and average prices increasing 3.2% to $698,622. While
CREA notes that economic uncertainty still lingers, it suggests confidence is
gradually improving as market conditions stabilize heading into 2026.

### Canadian mortgage reform update

On September 16, 2024, the federal government announced sweeping changes to
mortgage qualification rules for first-time home buyers, as well as those
purchasing newly-constructed homes.

**As of December 15, 2024:**

  * 30-year amortizations will be available for all first-time home buyers, regardless of whether they have an insured mortgage. These extended amortizations are also available for any purchase of new construction.  
  

  * The maximum purchase price for an insured mortgage (where less than 20% down is paid) will be increased to $1.5 million, from the current $1 million.  

These are some of the most impactful mortgage reforms announced since 2012,
and are anticipated to increase first-time home buyers’ affordability and
access to the housing market.

  * Variable [mortgage rates](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-rates) fluctuate with the prime lending rate.
  * Variable rates are typically stated as "prime plus or minus a percentage".
  * Some 5.36% of all mortgage requests made to Ratehub.ca from January - December 2023 were for 5-year variable-rate mortgages.
  * 5-year fixed mortgage rates are driven by 5-year government bond yields.
  * 23% of consumers opted for a variable-rate mortgage in 2024, down from 27% in 2023.

Historical 5-year variable mortgage rates

Checking historical mortgage rates is a great way to properly understand which
mortgage terms attract lower rates and whether rates are especially high or
low at any given moment. Here are the lowest 5-year variable rates of the year
in Canada for the last several years, compared to several other types of
mortgage rates.

### The popularity of 5-year variable mortgage rates

Although fixed-rate mortgages are more popular, according to [Mortgage
Professionals Canada](https://mortgageproscan.ca/docs/default-source/consumer-
reports/2023/march-2023_mpc-report_final_en.pdf?sfvrsn=c6b39b60_2), 25% of
Canadian mortgage-holders had variable-rate mortgages at the end of 2022,
making it the second most popular type of mortgage.

Historically, fixed rates are generally more popular, however, in the wake of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank of Canada [cut its target overnight lending
rate](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/second-emergency-rate-cut-march-2020/) in
March 2020, which caused the prime rate to go down. As a result, variable-rate
mortgages experienced a surge in popularity; as mentioned above, roughly 25%
of all mortgages in Canada at the end of 2022 were variable-rate mortgages, in
contrast to 20% in 2019. However, as variable-rate mortgages have climbed to
rates significantly higher than fixed-rate mortgages in the wake of multiple
Bank of Canada rate hikes over the course of 2022, their popularity has waned
considerably in 2023. While some 26% of all rate inquiries to Ratehub.ca in
2022 were for 5-year variable rates, they accounted for just 5.36% of all rate
requests to Ratehub in 2023. Moreover, according to the [2024 CMHC Mortgage
Consumer Survey](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/professionals/housing-markets-
data-and-research/housing-research/surveys/mortgage-consumer-
surveys/-/media/1b29e28201c54c6f8e9b9e4056cc6d4f.ashx), 23% of consumers opted
for a variable-rate mortgage in 2024 (down from 27% in 2023). The table below,
sourced from the same survey, shows the popularity of fixed-rate mortgages in
2024 among the four main categories of people who contracted mortgages.

**First-time home buyers** | **Repeat buyers** | **Renewers** | **Refinancers**  
---|---|---|---  
20% | 21% | 22% | 28%  
  
A 5-year mortgage term is the most popular duration. It sits right in the
middle of available mortgage term lengths, between one and 10 years, and,
thus, its popularity reflects a risk-neutral average. It also tends to be
heavily promoted by major lenders. A further breakdown of mortgage terms shows
that about 80% of mortgages have terms of five years or less.  

### What drives changes in 5-year variable mortgage rates?

As previously mentioned, the 5-year variable mortgage rate will fluctuate with
any movements in the prime lending rate, which is the rate at which banks lend
to their best and most credit-worthy customers. The variable mortgage rate is
typically stated as prime plus/minus a percentage discount/premium.

Canada’s prime rate is influenced primarily by economic conditions. The Bank
of Canada adjusts it depending on the state of the economy, determined by
various factors in employment, manufacturing, and exports. Together, these
shape the inflation rate. When inflation is high, the Bank of Canada must act
to avert an over-stimulated economy. They will increase the prime rate to make
the act of borrowing money more expensive.

Conversely, in cases where inflation is low, the Bank of Canada will decrease
the prime rate to stimulate the economy and improve the attractiveness of
borrowing. The discount/premium on the prime rate applied to the variable
mortgage rate is set by the banks, based on their rate strategy and desired
market share.

### The bottom line: Should you get a 5-year variable rate?

As long as you're comfortable with risk and understand that variable rates can
fluctuate throughout your term, then a 5-year variable rate is a reasonable
choice. Since variable rates do have the inherent risk of rate increases, make
sure you have enough money in your budget to cover a higher mortgage payment
if rates increase.

If you're still not sure about what mortgage product is right for you, it's a
