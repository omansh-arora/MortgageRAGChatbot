#  Buying a home

Becoming a homeowner can be very exciting, but it’s not always the best
decision for everyone. Before buying a home, such as a house or a condo, make
sure you consider all costs.

According to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), your monthly
housing costs should not be more than about 39% of your gross (before
deductions) monthly income. These costs include your mortgage payments,
property taxes and heat costs.

Your entire monthly debt load should not be more than 44% of your gross
monthly income. This includes your mortgage payments and all your other debts,
such as loan or credit card payments.

## Saving for your home

To buy your home, you’ll need a down payment. To accumulate the amount you
need, make saving part of your budget. Most employers deposit your pay
directly into your bank account. Set up automatic transfers to a savings
account for each pay period.

You’ll want to keep the money you save protected and easily accessible. Short-
term savings and investment options can include savings accounts, guaranteed
investment certificates (GIC) and low-risk mutual funds. Ask your financial
institution about the short-term investments they offer and how your money is
protected.

### Tax-Free Savings Account

A Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) lets you save or invest your money tax-free.
You won’t pay tax on money you withdraw from your TFSA. You can also use your
TFSA to help you buy a home.

### Registered Retirement Savings Plan

A Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) allows you to save money for your
retirement. You don’t pay taxes on your savings until you withdraw money from
the RRSP. You can also use your RRSP to help you buy a home.

### Deposit insurance

Deposit insurance protects your savings if your financial institution fails.
The Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) automatically insures your
eligible deposits. This applies to deposits held at CDIC member institutions
in Canada.

## Getting preapproved for your home

Before you start looking for the home you’d like to purchase, get preapproved
for a mortgage. Once you know what amount you qualify for, you can start
looking for the home that is right for you and your budget.

agency/services/mortgages/preapproval-qualify-mortgage.html)

## Finding your home

To find the home you want to buy, do your research. There are many websites,
online resources and mobile applications (apps) to help you find the right
home for you. Realtors can also help you with your research.

Using a realtor is optional. A realtor usually searches for homes, negotiates
a purchase price, fills out and files paperwork and more. The seller pays the
realtor’s fees when you buy a home.

process.](https://www.crea.ca/buyers-or-sellers/why-a-realtor/)

## Paying for your home

A mortgage is probably the biggest loan you’ll get in your lifetime. It’s
important that you understand the process.

agency/services/mortgages/preparing-mortgage.html)

Shop around to get the mortgage that is right for you. Mortgages have
different features to meet different needs. It’s important that you understand
them before you decide.

consumer-agency/services/mortgages/choose-mortgage.html)

## Home buying costs

When you buy a home, you have to pay for upfront costs in addition to your
mortgage. Upfront or closing costs are one-time fees that you have to pay when
you buy a home. You usually pay these costs by the time the sale is completed.
Examples include home inspection fees, legal fees, property tax adjustments
and title insurance. Be prepared to spend between 1.5% and 4% of the home’s
purchase price on these costs.
