## WATCH: October 29, 2025 Bank of Canada announcement

advertisement

### What is the best mortgage rate in Canada right now?

As of November 28, 2025, the best high-ratio, 5-year fixed mortgage rate in
Canada is 3.79% and the best high-ratio, 5-year variable mortgage rate is
3.45%. These rates are available across much of the country, including in
Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta.

* * *

### Will interest rates in Canada continue to go down in 2025?

It’s possible that interest rates will continue to go down in 2025, although
after October’s overnight rate cut, further drops seem unlikely. On October
29, 2025, the Bank of Canada marked its second consecutive cut, lowering its
benchmark overnight rate by 25 basis points to 2.25% – the lowest level since
July 2022. The move reflects a slowing job market and sluggish economic
growth, including a 7.1% unemployment rate in September and a 1.6% contraction
in GDP in the second quarter. As a result, the prime rate has fallen to 4.45%,
reducing borrowing costs for variable-rate mortgages, HELOCs, and other prime-
linked credit products. Due to the widely anticipated cut, fixed mortgage
rates have already adjusted to what bond markets priced in, remaining in the
2.5-2.6% range since mid-October. The lowest five-year fixed insured mortgage
rate is currently 3.79%. Looking ahead, further rate cuts are unlikely, given
the Bank's indication that it will hold rates in the coming months.

* * *

### What is the lowest mortgage rate in Canadian history?

According to Ratehub.ca’s historical mortgage rate database, the lowest five-
year variable mortgage rate was 0.85% in December 2021, and the lowest five-
year fixed rate was 1.39% in early 2021. These record lows came as the Bank of
Canada slashed rates in response to the pandemic’s economic impact in 2020. As
lockdowns lifted and consumer demand rebounded, inflation surged through 2022
and 2023, prompting the Bank to raise rates sharply. As of October 2025, the
lowest five-year fixed mortgage rate is 3.79%, and the lowest five-year
variable rate is 3.45%.

* * *

### How does inflation affect mortgage rates in Canada?

When inflation rises, the Bank of Canada typically increases its [overnight
lending rate](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgages/bank-of-canada-target-
overnight-rate) to slow down spending and encourage saving, which helps bring
inflation under control. Higher benchmark rates lead banks to raise their
prime lending rates, directly impacting variable mortgage rates, which are
tied to prime. As a result, variable rates increase when inflation is high.
Fixed mortgage rates, on the other hand, are influenced by bond yields, which
tend to rise when inflation expectations are elevated, leading lenders to
increase fixed rates. In September 2025, however, inflation came in at 2.4%,
just above the Bank of Canada’s 2% target. Despite growth, the Bank cut its
overnight rate to 2.25%, as it believes inflation will stabilize in the near
term.

* * *

### How do I get the best mortgage rate in Canada in 2025?

enter some basic information (i.e. down payment amount, purchase price,

### What is Canadian Lender and Big 6 Bank?

On our rate comparison tables, Ratehub.ca features generic brands like
“Canadian Lender”. The “Canadian Lender” rate represents the lowest rate our
brokerage can offer among the different lenders we work with. This means that
this rate can be from a Big Bank, trust company or lending company. The reason
we do not advertise the rate under the name of the actual lender offering it,
is because the rate is only available through our brokerage, via a special
volume discount or promotion.

Similarly, “Big 6 Bank” is another generic provider that is used to advertise
the lowest Big Bank rate that the Ratehub.ca brokerage can offer.

### November 2025: Mortgage market update

The Canadian housing market slowed earlier in 2025 as buyers grappled with
tariff concerns and economic volatility. Since then, the Bank of Canada has
implemented three rate holds, holding its benchmark rate stable at 2.75%. As
the market shows early signs of recovery, mortgage shoppers should stay
informed about the key factors influencing rates and affordability

  * **Real estate update:** Canada’s housing market continued its upward momentum in October 2025, with national home sales rising 0.9% from September, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA). This marks the sixth increase in the past seven months. While sales were still 4.3% lower than last October, activity remained aligned with the stronger conditions seen throughout 2025 as easing borrowing costs encouraged more buyers to return. New listings declined 1.4% month-over-month, tightening the flow of supply. With sales outpacing new inventory, the national sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) rose to 52.2%, up from 51% in September. This remains within balanced-market territory, but the steady climb points to slightly more competition for buyers. Active listings, however, stayed healthy at 189,000, up 7.2% year-over-year and close to long-term seasonal norms. Inventory conditions held stable, with months of inventory sitting at 4.4 for the fourth consecutive month, marking the lowest level since January 2025. Home prices showed modest improvement as the MLS® Home Price Index increased 0.2% from September, while remaining 3% below last year — the smallest annual decline since March. The national average sale price reached $690,195, down 1.1% annually, suggesting that prices have levelled off after several months of softening. CREA officials noted that underlying demand continues to build, with many prospective buyers waiting for additional rate relief before entering the market.

October](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/canadian-home-sales-rise-in-october/)

  * **CPI update:** Canada’s inflation rate cooled slightly in October, offering some relief for households. According to Statistics Canada, the Consumer Price Index rose 2.2% year over year, down from 2.4% the previous month and just above economists’ expectations of 2.1%. The pullback was driven largely by deeper declines in gas prices, which fell 9.4% compared to 4.1% in September. Excluding gasoline, inflation would have been higher at 2.6%. Food and shelter trends showed a mixed picture. Grocery price growth eased to 3.4% from 4% in September, the first meaningful monthly slowdown since 2020. Rent inflation ticked up to 5.2% from 4.8%, while mortgage interest costs continued to decline, falling to 2.9% from 3.6% as borrowing rates gradually came down. Meanwhile, cellular services increased 7.7% — the first year-over-year rise since early 2023 — following price hikes from several major carriers. Core inflation measures improved modestly. The CPI Trim eased to 3.0% from 3.1%, while the CPI Median declined to 2.9% from 3.1%. Both remain within the Bank of Canada's 1%–3% band but continue to sit slightly above the Bank’s comfort zone, suggesting that underlying inflation is stabilizing but not fully softening. Overall, the October report reinforces expectations that the Bank of Canada will maintain its rate hold in the near term.

### **Highlights from the Bank of Canada’s October 29, 2025 announcement**

On October 29, 2025, the Bank of Canada cut its overnight rate by 25 basis
points to 2.25%, marking its second consecutive cut, following a quarter-point
decrease last month. This latest rate cut was widely anticipated after recent
economic data pointed to growing weakness amid the extended trade war.

  * The cut supports a slowing labour market and sluggish economic growth driven by tariffs. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 7.1% in September, and GDP decreased by 1.6% in the second quarter of the year, highlighting the need for an economic boost. 
  * Canadians with variable-rate mortgages will see either lower monthly payments or a larger portion of their payments applied to the principal, depending on the mortgage type. For example, according to Ratehub.ca, a homeowner with a 25-year mortgage of $627,404 on a $676,154 home and a 5-year variable rate of 3.70% will see a decrease of $83 per month, or nearly $1,000 per year in their mortgage payments. But now that borrowing costs are lower, lenders may pass on smaller discounts, so securing a pre-approval rate can help lock in current prime spreads. 
  * Fixed mortgage rates are not directly tied to the BoC’s rate but are influenced by bond yields. With Canadian and U.S. yields trending lower, lenders have started cutting fixed-rate mortgage rates. The lowest five-year fixed on Ratehub.ca is now 3.79%, a level not seen since spring.
  * For savers and investors in prime-linked products such as GICS and high-interest savings accounts, the rate cut means lower returns. However they remain attractive options for those seeking stable returns in an uncertain environment.
  * Looking ahead, further rate cuts are unlikely as the Bank noted it will hold rates in future months.

rate-to-2-25-in-october-2025-announcement/)

### Canada housing market forecast for 2025

CREA has revised its housing market forecasts for 2025 and 2026, reflecting a
slower recovery than initially anticipated. After a rebound began in late
2024, renewed economic uncertainty and tariff-related disruptions early in
2025 temporarily sidelined many buyers. However, since March 2025, sales have
steadily increased, suggesting demand was only postponed rather than
eliminated. CREA now expects 473,093 homes to change hands in 2025, a modest
1.1% decline from 2024, largely due to weaker activity in Canada’s most
expensive markets. The national average home price is projected to fall 1.4%
to $676,705, as price declines in B.C. and Ontario outweigh 4%–8% gains across
most other provinces. Looking ahead, CREA forecasts a strong rebound in 2026,
with sales rising 7.7% to 509,479 — the highest level since 2021 — and average
prices climbing 3.2% to $698,622, marking a return to the $700,000 range.
While optimism is growing, CREA notes that forecasts still carry a higher-
than-usual degree of uncertainty amid ongoing economic fluctuations.

### Canadian mortgage reform update

On September 16, 2024, the federal government announced sweeping changes to
mortgage qualification rules for first-time home buyers, as well as those
purchasing newly-constructed homes.

**As of December 15, 2024:**

  * 30-year amortizations will be available for all first-time home buyers, regardless of whether they have an insured mortgage. These extended amortizations are also available for any purchase of new construction.  
  

  * The maximum purchase price for an insured mortgage (where less than 20% down is paid) will be increased to $1.5 million, from the current $1 million.  

These are some of the most impactful mortgage reforms announced since 2012,
and are anticipated to increase first-time home buyers’ affordability and
access to the housing market.

## Factors that can affect your mortgage rate in Canada

It’s important to understand that the best mortgage rate you qualify for may
change depending on your unique borrowing profile. Here are some of the
factors that influence what mortgage rate you qualify for:

**The type of mortgage:** If your mortgage is for a
[refinance](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-refinance), rather than a purchase
or renewal, you’ll be eligible for higher rates. For individuals with an
existing mortgage who have good credit and more than 20% equity in their
homes, in addition to refinancing, you can also explore a [home equity line of
credit](https://www.ratehub.ca/home-equity-line-of-credit) (HELOC).

**Your down payment:** If you’re purchasing a home and your down payment is
less than 20% of the purchase price and the value of the home you are
purchasing is less than $1 million, you’ll be required to purchase [mortgage
default insurance](https://www.ratehub.ca/cmhc-mortgage-insurance) (sometimes
known as CMHC insurance). This insurance is added to your mortgage amount and,
while it will cost you money, it will result in a lower mortgage rate as your
mortgage is less risky for your lender. If you’re renewing your mortgage, in
order to be eligible for the lowest mortgage rates you would have needed to
purchase CMHC insurance on the original mortgage.

**Your intended use of the property:** Your mortgage rate will be higher if
you plan to rent your property out vs. live in it as your primary residence.

**Your amortization period:** Insurable mortgages (i.e. mortgages for homes
valued at less than $1 million with a down payment of less than 20% of the
purchase price) in Canada have a maximum
[amortization](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/tag/amortization/) period of 25
years. Regardless of the price of your home, if you make a down payment of at
least 20%, you are able to access a mortgage that allows a longer amortization
period, such as a 30-year period. While longer amortization periods will
usually result in a lower monthly payment, they can come with a slightly
higher interest rate. Moreover, by taking longer to pay back the mortgage, you
will pay more in interest overall than you would with a shorter amortization
period.

## How to choose between a fixed or variable mortgage rate in Canada

#### **Variable vs. fixed mortgage rates**

The difference between [fixed and variable mortgage
rates](https://www.ratehub.ca/variable-or-fixed-mortgage) is whether or not
they will change over the term of your mortgage. Fixed rates will stay the
same over the course of your mortgage term (usually 5 years), while variable
rates will change alongside changes in your lender’s [prime
rate](https://www.ratehub.ca/prime-rate).

#### **Fixed mortgage rates:**

Fixed mortgage rates are a historically popular option, with [5-year fixed
mortgage rates](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-rates/5-year/fixed)
accounting for 80% of all mortgage requests made on Ratehub.ca from January to
December 2023. Moreover, according to the [2024 CMHC Mortgage Consumer

surveys/-/media/1b29e28201c54c6f8e9b9e4056cc6d4f.ashx), 69% of all mortgages
contracted in 2024 were fixed-rate mortgages. The benefit of a fixed mortgage
is that you are protected against interest rate fluctuations, so your regular
payments stay constant over the duration of your term, regardless of what
happens in the market. A fixed rate mortgage is ideal for you if you have a
low appetite for risk. You’ll know how much you’ll be paying monthly right
from the outset and not have to monitor interest rates.

#### **Variable mortgage rates:**

Variable mortgage rates are typically lower than fixed rates but can vary over
the duration of your term. Variable mortgages are prone to market behaviour
(via the prime rate) which affects your payments. That means your payment
amounts can change over time. Variable rates remained substantially lower than
fixed rates throughout 2021 and into 2022, leading a large number of buyers to
opt for [5-year variable-rate mortgages](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-
rates/5-year/variable). However, as variable-rate mortgages climbed to rates
that are higher than fixed-rate mortgages over the course of ten rate hikes
between March 2022 and July 2023, their popularity has substantially
diminished. According to the [2024 CMHC Mortgage Consumer
Survey](https://www.cmhc-schl.gc.ca/professionals/housing-markets-data-and-
research/housing-research/surveys/mortgage-consumer-
surveys/-/media/1b29e28201c54c6f8e9b9e4056cc6d4f.ashx), 23% of mortgages
contracted during 2024 were variable-rate mortgages (down from 27% in 2023).

While variable rates are generally lower, they do fluctuate and can be viewed
as more risky when compared to fixed rates. Moreover, variable rates have
actually been higher than fixed rates since the end of 2022. That said,
variable mortgage rates have some key advantages you should know about:

  * You can convert a variable rate to a fixed rate at any time without a penalty as long as you stay with your original mortgage lender.
  * Breaking a variable rate mortgage is substantially less expensive than breaking a fixed rate mortgage. To estimate the cost of breaking your mortgage, our [mortgage penalty calculator](https://www.ratehub.ca/penalty-calculator) is a useful tool. 

According to York University Professor Moshe Milevsky’s landmark 2001
[study](https://www.fields.utoronto.ca/programs/cim/financial_math/00-01/mac_risk_conf/moshe_milevsky.pdf),
historically, over 90% of Canadians who have maintained a variable mortgage
rate throughout their entire mortgage term have paid less in interest than
those who have stuck to a fixed rate.

## How to select the term for your mortgage rate

Choosing between a [short-term mortgage or a long-term
mortgage](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-term) can also affect your interest
rate. A short-term mortgage generally offers a lower rate, and, as it requires
more frequent renewal, you can benefit from lower interest rates when you
renew, if rates stay low at your renewal. Long-term mortgages, on the other
hand, offer stability, as you won’t need to renew it often. However, long-term
mortgage holders may not be able to take advantage of lower interest rates if
the market fluctuates.

#### **Open vs. closed mortgages**

If you’re wondering whether to get an open or closed mortgage, the answer is,
while an open mortgage may make sense in certain circumstances, the
overwhelming majority of Canadians opt for a closed mortgage. While open
mortgages have extra flexibility that you might need, closed mortgages are by
far the more popular choice not only due to their lower rates, but also
because most home buyers do not intend to pay off their mortgages in the short
term. Moreover, fixed-rate open mortgages do not exist and variable-rate
mortgages are very rare. The most common type of open mortgage is the [Home
Equity Line of Credit (HELOC)](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-
rates/heloc). Below are some quick facts about the differences between open
and closed mortgages, and you can also find more detailed information on our
blog about [open vs. closed mortgages](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/open-vs-
closed-mortgage-whats-the-difference/).

#### **Closed mortgages:**

Closed mortgages have lower rates compared to open mortgages. Closed mortgages
can come in fixed and variable form, but place restrictions on the amount of
principal you can pay down each year. If you pay off the entire principal in a
closed mortgage before the set term, you will face a prepayment penalty, which
is normally a 3-month interest charge.

#### **Open mortgages:**

Open mortgages allow you to pay off your entire mortgage balance at any time
throughout the term. The drawback is that you pay a premium for that option in
the form of higher rates. You might opt for an open mortgage if you are
planning to move in the near future, or if you’re expecting a lump sum of
money through an inheritance or bonus that would allow you to pay more of your
mortgage off.

## How do I qualify for a mortgage in Canada?

While it’s important to think about qualifying for the best rates, you should
also give some thought to the basics that you’ll need to qualify and get
approved for your mortgage. To qualify for a mortgage, here are some of the
most important things that prospective lenders will want to see.

**A good credit score -** You should have a credit score of 680 or higher to
qualify for the best mortgage rates, but to qualify for a mortgage at all,
you’ll need a credit score of at least 560. In addition to looking at your
credit score, prospective lenders will also consider any derogatory
information from your credit report, such as any missed payments (particularly
if they have gone to collections). If you have [bad
credit](https://www.ratehub.ca/credit-score/understand-your-credit-score),
generally defined as a credit score of less than 660, you are unlikely to
qualify for the best mortgage rates, and instead you’ll need to use a sub-
prime mortgage lender like Equitable Bank or Home Trust. If your credit score
is even less than 600, you will most probably need to use a private lender
like WealthBridge. Sub-prime mortgage lenders are happy to work with people
with a poor credit history, but they will charge higher mortgage rates. It's a
good idea to have a detailed understanding of how your [credit
score](https://www.ratehub.ca/credit-score) affects your ability to obtain a
mortgage.

**Proof of income -** You’ll also need to provide proof of income in the form
of pay stubs and/or tax documents like your Notice of Assessment (NOA). Keep
in mind that if you recently started a new job, even with proof of income,
many lenders will want to see that you’ve held the position for at least a
year.

## How the stress test impacts mortgage qualification

In Canada, anyone applying for a new mortgage loan must pass the [mortgage
stress test](https://www.ratehub.ca/blog/how-to-stress-test-your-mortgage/).
The purpose of the stress test is to ensure the borrower could still manage to
make their mortgage payments in the case that interest rates rise over the
course of their term. The criteria for the stress test is a benchmark rate of
5.25% or the borrower’s contract rate plus 2% – whichever is higher. For
example, if your lender offers you a mortgage rate of 5%, you’ll need to prove
you could afford to make your payments at 7% in order to pass the test and
qualify for your mortgage loan.  
  
The standards for the mortgage stress test are upheld by the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), Canada’s federal banking
regulator, for low-ratio, uninsured mortgages. The criteria for high-ratio and
insured mortgages is governed by the federal Department of Finance, though
they follow exactly the standards put in place by OSFI.

All mortgage borrowers must be stress tested, with two exceptions:  

  * Borrowers who are renewing their mortgage term at their original lender often are not re-stress tested.  

  * Borrowers with high-ratio, insured mortgages switching to another lender at renewal may not be stress tested, as long as the original terms of their loan and amortization do not change.

## Historical Canada mortgage rates

Looking at historical mortgage rates in Canada is a good way to understand
which types of mortgage attract higher rates. They also make it easier to
understand whether we’re currently in a low or higher rate environment,
relatively speaking.

### **Is it worth working with a mortgage broker?**

First, what exactly is a [mortgage broker](https://www.ratehub.ca/mortgage-
brokers-canada)? Independent mortgage brokers are licensed mortgage
specialists who have access to multiple lenders and mortgage rates. They
essentially negotiate the lowest rate for you, and because they acquire high
quantities of mortgage products, mortgage brokers can pass volume discounts
directly to you. There are advantages to getting a mortgage directly from a
lender as well as getting a mortgage through a broker, but there are
differences between going with a [bank vs. a mortgage
broker](https://www.ratehub.ca/bank-vs-mortgage-broker). While going directly
to your current bank lets you consolidate your financial products, using a
broker allows you to shop around quickly and easily, at no cost to you.

Luckily, you don’t need to choose one or the other. You can speak to multiple
banks and use a mortgage broker if you want to. Ratehub.ca is a great place to
start, as we compare the best mortgage rates in Canada from multiple lenders.
Once you’ve compared your options, we can put you in contact with your chosen
provider.
