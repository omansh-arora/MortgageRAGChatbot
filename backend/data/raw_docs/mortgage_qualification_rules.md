# Mortgage Qualification Rules (Summary for Bot)

## 1. Basic Approval Rules

When lenders decide yes/no, they mainly look at:

- **Income**
  - At least **3 months** in a full-time job.
  - Stable and verifiable income.
- **Debts**
  - Existing loans and monthly payments reduce how much mortgage you qualify for.
- **Credit Score**
  - **Minimum ~600** to work with most “A” lenders.
  - **680+ preferred**, unless the client is new to Canada.
- **Down Payment**
  - **Minimum 5%** down payment for owner-occupied properties within the allowed price range.

## 2. Down Payment & Insurance

### Minimum Down Payment

- **Purchase price under $500,000**
  - Minimum **5%** down.
- **Purchase price from $500,000 to $999,999**
  - **5%** of the first $500,000 **plus**
  - **10%** of the remaining amount.

### Insured vs. Uninsured Mortgages

- **Insured mortgage**
  - **Less than 20% down payment.**
  - Property must be **owner-occupied** or a **second home** (not rental).
  - Maximum **property price**: about **$1,499,999**.
  - Corresponding **maximum mortgage**: about **$1,374,999**.
  - Client pays a **mortgage insurance premium** (e.g., CMHC).

- **Uninsured mortgage**
  - **20% or more** down payment.
  - No default insurance premium.
  - Banks often use slightly **more flexible qualifying ratios** with 20%+ down.
  - For properties above ~$1.5M, lenders may use a **sliding scale** for minimum down payment (higher % required as price goes up).

### Effect of Bigger Down Payment

- **20%+ down payment**:
  - No CMHC (or similar) insurance premium.
  - Lenders may stretch the **maximum mortgage amount** a bit more.
- **Less than 20% down**:
  - Mortgage is **insured**.
  - Subject to insurance rules and price caps.

## 3. Income & Employment Types

### Salary Job

- Typically need:
  - At least **3 months** in the role.
  - **Full-time** status.
  - **Employment letter** confirming position, salary, and status.
- Lenders treat this as stable income.

### Hourly Job

- If the **employment letter guarantees hours**:
  - Treated similar to a salaried job.
- If **part-time** or **non-guaranteed hours**:
  - Lenders usually use a **2-year average** of income (from T4s / tax docs).

### Self-Employed / Business Owner / Contractor

- Treated like self-employed.
- Lenders look at:
  - **Last 2 years of declared income** on tax returns (T1 Generals).
  - Usually use the **2-year average** of what the client pays themselves.

### Time in Job

- To be “safe” for approval:
  - At least **3 months on the job**.
  - **Probation period should be over** (no longer on probation).

## 4. Credit Score

### Typical Minimums

- **A lenders**:
  - Prefer **680+** credit score.
  - Will sometimes work with **600+** depending on the file.
- **B lenders**:
  - Work with **lower scores**.
  - Require:
    - **Minimum 20% down payment**.
    - **~1% fee** on the mortgage amount.
    - **Higher interest rates**.

### If Credit Score Is Low

- **Yes, they can still get a mortgage**, often through **B lenders**.
- What changes:
  - Need **20%+ down payment**.
  - Pay **lender/broker fee (~1% of mortgage)**.
  - **Higher rate** than A lenders.
  - Sometimes more conservative approval amounts.

## 5. Debts and Liabilities

Lenders look at **monthly payments**, not just balances.

- **Car payments**
  - Counted fully as a liability.
  - Can **significantly reduce** the maximum mortgage approval.

- **Credit cards**
  - If balances are small and paid on time:
    - Usually not a big issue for qualification.
  - Large ongoing balances and payments can **hurt borrowing capacity**.

- **Lines of credit**
  - Any **used balance** is counted as a liability.
  - Reduces how much mortgage the client can qualify for.

- **Student loans**
  - Lenders either:
    - Use **1% of the outstanding balance** as a monthly payment, or
    - Use the **actual payment amount** shown on documentation.

### When to Pay Off Debt First

- If a debt payment is **pulling down the client’s max mortgage** and they need a higher amount, the broker may advise:
  - **“You need to pay off this debt first, or you won’t qualify for the mortgage amount you want.”**

## 6. Property Type Rules

### Owner-Occupied (Home You Live In)

- Can be purchased with **less than 20% down payment** (as low as 5% within allowed price and insurance rules).

### Rental Property

- Typically requires at least **20% down payment**.
- Different rules on how rental income is counted.

### Second Home / Vacation Property

- Can sometimes be purchased with **less than 20% down** if:
  - It is for **personal use**.
  - The client **qualifies** under income and debt rules.

### Harder Property Types

Some properties are **case-by-case** and more difficult:

- **Mobile homes**.
- **Rural properties** in **ALR (Agricultural Land Reserve)**.
- **Lots larger than ~10 acres**.
- Properties with a **history of grow-ops**.
- Homes on **leased land**.
- **Condos / stratas** with issues, such as:
  - High special assessments or levies.
  - Ongoing litigation.
  - Very low contingency reserve funds.
  - Serious building condition problems.

These may still be approved, but lenders are more cautious and may decline or limit financing.

## 7. Simple “Back-of-the-Envelope” Rules

These are rough rules the broker often repeats to clients (for **owner-occupied**, **no major debts**):

- **Down payment < 20%**
  - Clients usually qualify for about **4.5–4.7×** their **guaranteed yearly income**.
  - The exact number depends on whether they are **first-time home buyers** and other file details.

- **Down payment ≥ 20%**
  - Clients can often qualify for around **5–5.5×** their **guaranteed yearly income**.

These are estimates, not guarantees. Final approval always depends on lender policies, documents, and full underwriting.
